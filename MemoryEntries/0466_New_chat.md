Can you define protogynus 

**assistant:**

Protogyny is a type of hermaphroditism in which an organism is capable of changing its sex from female to male. This typically occurs in fish and other aquatic animals, and is triggered by changes in environmental factors such as water temperature or the presence of other individuals.


**user:**

There's another word similar what is it prata

**assistant:**

I'm not familiar with the word "prata" in the context of hermaphrodites or sex change in animals. Can you provide more information or context?
It might be a misspelling or a word from a different language.
