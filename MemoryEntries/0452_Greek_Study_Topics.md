In the 5th century BCE, ancient Greece was a hub of intellectual and philosophical activity, and many fields of study were being developed and explored. The three topics you have mentioned, arithmetic, astronomy, and harmonizing, were indeed important areas of study during this time period. 

Arithmetic, which is the study of numbers and their properties, was one of the fundamental branches of mathematics in ancient Greece. The Pythagoreans, a group of mathematicians and philosophers who were active during the 5th century BCE, were particularly interested in arithmetic and believed that everything in the universe could be reduced to numbers.

Astronomy, the study of celestial objects and their movements, was also an important field of study in ancient Greece during this time. Greek astronomers such as Eudoxus, Meton, and Hipparchus made important observations and measurements of the stars and planets, and developed models to explain their movements.

Harmonizing, or music theory, was another important area of study in ancient Greece. The Pythagoreans believed that music had a mathematical basis and that the intervals between notes could be expressed as ratios of whole numbers.

In addition to these three topics, other important areas of study in ancient Greece during the 5th century BCE included philosophy, literature, and art. The works of famous philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, epic poems such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and the architectural achievements of the Greeks, such as the Parthenon, continue to inspire and influence people to this day.
