# Assist Afghan Asylum Seekers

_Created: 2023-02-06T04:41:23+00:00_

**user:**

I know a family who was detained at the United States border for illegal immigration. They are from Afghanistan. The children were separated from the parents and the parents are in detention. One parent contacted my friend. She claims to require sponsorship in order to even gain access to her children. What do I do?

**assistant:**

If the family is seeking asylum in the United States, they may be eligible for sponsorship through the asylum process. 

You can start by contacting a legal aid organization or an immigration attorney to assist the family in their case. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) can help you find an immigration attorney in your area. You can also contact organizations such as the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) or the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for assistance.

Additionally, you can contact the appropriate government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Health and Human Services to inquire about the family's situation and ask for information on how to sponsor them. 

It is important to note that immigration law can be complex and the situation may be difficult, so seeking the help of a qualified professional is recommended.
