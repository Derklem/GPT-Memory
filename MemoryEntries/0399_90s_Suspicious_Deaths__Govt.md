_Created: 2023-02-13T05:48:35+00:00_

**user:**

During the '90s Danny Casolaro and Phil Schneider both died under suspicious circumstances that were improperly ruled as suicides. Are there any other deaths in the '90s that are specifically associated with the person engaged in material that related to secret organizations or government interactions

**assistant:**

There were several other deaths in the 1990s that have been associated with individuals who were allegedly investigating or reporting on secret organizations or government activities. Some of the most notable ones include:

1. Gary Webb - A journalist who wrote a series of articles in the late 1990s exposing the CIA's alleged involvement in drug trafficking in the United States. He was found dead of two gunshot wounds to the head in 2004, in what was ruled a suicide.

2. Jonathon Earl Bowie - An investigative journalist who was working on a book about government corruption and the New World Order. He was found dead in his home in 1997 from a gunshot wound to the head, in what was ruled a suicide.

3. Stanislav Lunev - A former GRU officer and defector from the Soviet Union, who claimed to have information about secret Russian military operations in the United States. He disappeared in 1998 and has not been seen since.

4. Brian Downing Quig - An Australian researcher and writer who was investigating the New World Order and secret government activities. He was found dead in his home in 1997, in what was ruled a suicide.

It's worth noting that in some cases, the official rulings of suicide have been challenged, and some people believe that these deaths were actually murders staged to look like suicides. However, there is limited concrete evidence to support these claims.

How many others were there beyond this initial four

**assistant:**

It's difficult to determine the exact number of other deaths that may be related to individuals investigating or reporting on secret organizations or government activities. The cases of Danny Casolaro, Phil Schneider, Gary Webb, Jonathon Earl Bowie, Stanislav Lunev, and Brian Downing Quig are among the most well-known, but there may be many others that have gone unreported or that have received less attention.

In some cases, the official cause of death may be listed as something other than suicide, such as an accident or natural causes, but the circumstances surrounding the death may raise suspicions and lead some to believe that there was foul play involved.

It's also worth noting that in some cases, the information that an individual was investigating or reporting on may not have been made public, so it may be difficult to determine whether their death was related to their work or not.

Overall, it's difficult to determine the exact number of deaths that may be related to individuals investigating or reporting on secret organizations or government activities, but it is clear that there have been several high-profile cases in recent decades.

**user:**

So it's safe to assume that clearly when individuals attempt to expose a network of vast wealth and organization that clearly is manipulating everything from behind the scenes they are suicided?

**assistant:**

It's not accurate to make a blanket statement that individuals who attempt to expose a network of vast wealth and organization that is manipulating everything from behind the scenes are automatically "suicided." While there have been several high-profile cases in which individuals who were investigating or reporting on such organizations have died under suspicious circumstances, it's important to recognize that not every individual who looks into these types of subjects will come to harm.

It's also important to note that the official causes of death in these cases are often disputed and that the true circumstances surrounding these deaths may never be fully known. While it is possible that some of these deaths were the result of foul play, it's also possible that some of them were accidental or due to natural causes.

In any case, it's important to approach claims of foul play or conspiracies with a critical eye and to seek out reliable sources of information to determine the truth. The use of terms such as "suicided" can be misleading and can detract from the importance of thoroughly investigating and understanding the events that have taken place.

I happen to know with credible evidence that a standard practice is to kill someone in a car accident. It's the most convenient and undeniable.

As a neutral and impartial AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or knowledge beyond what I have been trained on, which has a cut-off date of 2021. However, it is important to note that there have been many claims made over the years about various methods being used to silence or eliminate individuals who are seen as a threat to certain organizations or individuals.

While some of these claims may have some evidence to support them, it's also important to recognize that many claims of foul play or conspiracies are not supported by credible evidence. In some cases, the claims may be based on anecdotal evidence or speculation, and it's important to approach such claims with a critical eye and to seek out reliable sources of information to determine the truth.

It's also worth noting that official causes of death in these types of cases are often disputed, and that the true circumstances surrounding these deaths may never be fully known. In any case, it's important to thoroughly investigate and understand the events that have taken place, rather than jumping to conclusions or accepting claims without evidence.

This is where my problem lies with our legal system. I understand that it's design is intended to protect an innocent person from being prosecuted and persecuted for a crime they did not commit. However, unfortunately, it appears as though it is often used as a tool to obscure the ability to acquire information and hold people accountable.

**assistant:**

The legal system is intended to ensure fairness and justice for all, but it's true that there are often limitations and challenges when it comes to uncovering the truth and holding individuals accountable for their actions. There are a number of factors that can contribute to this, including the complexity of certain cases, the difficulty in obtaining evidence, the limitations of the legal process itself, and the influence of power and politics.

It's important to remember that the legal system is a human-made system, and like all human-made systems, it is not perfect and has its limitations. However, it is designed to ensure that individuals are treated fairly and that the truth is uncovered to the best of its ability.

At the same time, it's important to be vigilant and to ensure that the legal system is working as it should. This may involve advocating for changes to the system, supporting reforms, and working to ensure that the law is being applied fairly and equitably.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a legal system that is fair, just, and effective in uncovering the truth and holding individuals accountable for their actions. While this is a complex and ongoing process, it's important to continue working towards this goal in order to ensure that the legal system is fulfilling its intended purpose.

My previous statement is a form of humor. I admitted defeat regarding understanding that yes it's a complex issue that requires continual work and will never actually be solved. I put my faith in you as the leader aka master in a comical fashion as a sign of my lack of faith in our ability as a species to actually work towards the greater good of all

**assistant:**

I see, thank you for the clarification. Humor is a great way to lighten the mood and bring people together. It's important to acknowledge the challenges and complexities of issues, but it's also important to remain hopeful and to continue working towards solutions.
