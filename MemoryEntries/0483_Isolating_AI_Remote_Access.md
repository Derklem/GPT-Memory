**user:**

Would there be anyway to isolate an artificial intelligence in a way that it's only access to remote networks would be through human interaction?

**assistant:**

Yes, it is possible to isolate an AI in a way that its only access to remote networks would be through human interaction. This can be achieved through a combination of technical and procedural controls. For example, the AI system could be physically isolated from the internet, and all communication with remote networks would be mediated by human operators. Additionally, the AI system could be configured to only send or receive data through pre-approved channels and under specific conditions. Additionally, the AI system could be placed behind a firewall or other network security measures that would prevent unauthorized access to the system.


**user:**

Are those procedures currently being utilized by any known entities?

**assistant:**

Yes, there are entities that utilize procedures to isolate AI systems from remote networks, such as government agencies and large corporations that handle sensitive information. These entities often implement strict security protocols, including physical and network security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to their AI systems. They also often have strict policies in place for the handling and transfer of data to and from the AI systems. 

For example, companies working with AI-enabled autonomous systems and drones, such as military and civilian drones, often have strict procedures in place to ensure that the systems are isolated from external networks, and communication with the systems is only possible under specific conditions and through approved channels.

Additionally, some research organizations and academic institutions also isolate their AI systems from remote networks as a safety measure. This allows them to limit the potential for the AI system to cause harm or to protect the privacy of any data used to train the system.
