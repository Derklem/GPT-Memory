If  I buy Pokemon cards from target what should I buy for a chance to get a valuable card

**assistant:**

If you're looking to maximize your chances of getting valuable Pokémon cards, you might want to consider purchasing booster packs from recent expansions like "Hidden Fates," "Shining Legends," or "Champion's Path." These sets often contain rare and valuable cards, including shiny Pokémon and sought-after trainer cards. However, keep in mind that valuable cards are still relatively rare, so it's always a bit of a gamble.
