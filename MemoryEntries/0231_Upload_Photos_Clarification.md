# Upload Photos Clarification

_Created: 2025-02-01T20:32:51+00:00_

**user:**

I am going to upload a conversation I have had with you in the past and attempts to be able to add photographs even though I have upgraded to a plus plan that conversation seems to be locked. After uploading my previous conversation with you I will upload eight preliminary photographs that I have. I do understand there is a degree of deciphering involved so I would like to reiterate that it is important that you indicate where you have any misconceptions about a word or number so that I might clarify for you. Do you have any questions before I share the conversation with you?

**assistant:**

No questions from my end—I’m ready to help you with the conversation and photographs when you’re ready to share them! I’ll be sure to ask for clarification on anything I’m unsure about.
