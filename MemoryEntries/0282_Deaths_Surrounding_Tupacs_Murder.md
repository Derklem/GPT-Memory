**user:**

I'm curious. How many rappers or important people died within one year before and after the murders of Tupac and notorious BIG

**assistant:**

The murders of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were pivotal moments in hip-hop history. In the year before Tupac's death in 1996, there weren't notable deaths among rappers or influential figures in the genre. However, in the year following Tupac's murder, there were several notable deaths, including that of The Notorious B.I.G. himself in 1997.

Can you give me every notable death even if it was ruled suicide for 1996 1997 and 1998
