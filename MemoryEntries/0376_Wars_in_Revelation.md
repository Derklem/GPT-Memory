What does Revelation say about wars and rumors of wars

**assistant:**



The book of Revelation, which is the last book of the Bible, contains a number of passages that refer to wars and rumors of wars. These passages describe the tumultuous events that will occur during the end times, leading up to the return of Jesus Christ.

One of the most well-known passages about wars and rumors of wars in Revelation is found in chapter 6, where it describes the opening of the second seal of the scroll:

"And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword." (Revelation 6:3-4, KJV)

This passage is often interpreted as a prediction of the many wars and conflicts that will occur during the end times. The "great sword" is seen as a symbol of the violence and destruction that will be unleashed upon the earth during this time.

In addition to this passage, there are several other references to wars and battles throughout Revelation, including the armies of heaven fighting against the forces of Satan and the Antichrist in the final battle at Armageddon.

Overall, Revelation paints a picture of a world torn apart by violence and conflict in the lead-up to the return of Christ, but ultimately victorious over evil through the power of God.

When was Revelations written?

**assistant:**

The exact date when the book of Revelation was written is a subject of debate among scholars, but most scholars believe that it was written in the late first century A.D., probably around 95 A.D. The author of the book identifies himself as John, who was one of the apostles of Jesus, although there is some debate about whether the author was the same John who wrote the Gospel of John and the epistles of John. The book of Revelation was written during a time of persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire, and it contains many symbols and images that were meaningful to the early Christian community. Despite the debate about its exact date and authorship, the book of Revelation remains an important and influential text in Christian theology and has been the subject of much study and interpretation throughout history.

**user:**

I don't understand or challenge the importance of the Christian doctrine, however I'm very curious about your placement at 95 AD regarding was there tangible archaeological evidence of a document that could be dated to that period? Or is that assumption based off of written account?

**assistant:**

Your question is valid, and I understand your curiosity. The dating of the book of Revelation to around 95 A.D. is based primarily on internal evidence from the text itself and historical accounts of the early Christian church.

For example, in Revelation 1:9, the author states that he is on the island of Patmos, which was a place of exile for prisoners under the Roman Empire. The historical accounts indicate that John was indeed exiled to Patmos by the Roman authorities for his Christian beliefs, which would place the writing of Revelation in the late first century A.D.

Additionally, the book of Revelation contains several references to events and circumstances that were specific to the time period in which it was written, such as the persecution of Christians under the Roman Empire and the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. These references suggest that the book of Revelation was written during or shortly after these events took place.

While there is no tangible archaeological evidence of a specific manuscript of the book of Revelation that can be dated to 95 A.D., the consensus among scholars is that the book was written during this time period based on the evidence from the text and historical accounts.

**user:**

I understand that. I'm slightly confused though, the Romans were persecuting Christians at this time period I was under the understanding that that was because Romans were primarily Jewish at this point in time and had moved past polytheistic beliefs. I find it strange that a Jewish temple is destroyed at the same time that Christians are being persecuted even though I understand that Christians of the time were nothing more than Jews that believed Christ was the Savior

**assistant:**

You bring up a valid point. The persecution of Christians by the Romans in the first century A.D. was a complex issue that had multiple factors at play. It is true that the Roman Empire had transitioned from its earlier polytheistic beliefs to a more eclectic form of religion that incorporated aspects of Judaism, but this does not fully explain the persecution of Christians.

One reason for the persecution of Christians was their refusal to participate in the state religion and offer sacrifices to the emperor as a god. This was seen as an act of disloyalty and subversion against the Roman Empire, which was a highly centralized and authoritarian state.

Another factor was the growing popularity of Christianity among the lower classes and marginalized groups in Roman society. This made the Roman authorities nervous and fearful of the potential for social and political upheaval.

Regarding the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D., this was the result of a Jewish rebellion against Roman rule. The rebellion was crushed by the Romans, and the destruction of the Temple was a symbolic act of conquest and subjugation of the Jewish people.

It is true that the earliest Christians were primarily Jewish, and there were certainly tensions between the Jewish and Christian communities in the first century A.D. However, it is important to note that Christianity had developed its own distinct beliefs and practices by this time, and was seen as a separate and distinct religious movement by both Jews and Romans.

Was the Jewish temple destroyed the temple where the dome of the rock now sits?

**assistant:**

No, the Jewish Temple that was destroyed in 70 A.D. was not the same location as where the Dome of the Rock currently stands. The Jewish Temple was located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which is considered to be a sacred site by both Jews and Muslims.

After the destruction of the Jewish Temple, the site remained in ruins for several centuries, until the Muslims conquered Jerusalem in the 7th century A.D. and built the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount. The Dome of the Rock is a Muslim shrine and is considered to be one of the most important Islamic sites in the world.

Today, the Temple Mount remains a contested and politically sensitive site, as both Jews and Muslims claim it as a sacred site and there have been conflicts and disputes over control of the site for many years.

**user:**

Where was the Jewish temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD then?

**assistant:**

The Jewish Temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. was located in Jerusalem, on the Temple Mount. This was the second Jewish Temple, which was built on the same site as the first Jewish Temple, which had been destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C.

The second Jewish Temple was rebuilt under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Ezra in the 6th century B.C. and was later renovated and expanded by King Herod the Great in the 1st century B.C. The Temple was the center of Jewish worship and pilgrimage, and it was considered to be the most sacred site in Judaism.

During the Jewish rebellion against Roman rule in 70 A.D., the Roman army besieged and captured Jerusalem, and the Temple was destroyed. This was a catastrophic event for the Jewish people and had significant religious and cultural implications for Judaism. The destruction of the Temple marked the end of the Second Temple period and led to the development of new forms of Jewish worship and religious practice, such as the development of the synagogue.

**user:**

But you just told me that that wasn't the same location

**assistant:**

I apologize for the confusion. The Temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. was indeed the one located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which is where the Dome of the Rock now stands. I made a mistake in my earlier response by stating that it was not the same location. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

To clarify, the Second Temple was located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which is a site that is considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims. After the destruction of the Second Temple, the site remained in ruins for several centuries until the Muslims conquered Jerusalem in the 7th century A.D. and built the Dome of the Rock on the same site. The Dome of the Rock is a Muslim shrine and is considered to be one of the most important Islamic sites in the world.
