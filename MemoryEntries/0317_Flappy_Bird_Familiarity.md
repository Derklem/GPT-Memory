**user:**

are you familiar with flappy bird

**assistant:**

Yes, I'm familiar with Flappy Bird. Flappy Bird was a mobile game developed by Vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen and released in 2013. The game became incredibly popular due to its simple yet challenging gameplay. In Flappy Bird, players control a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by passing through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them.

Despite its success, Dong Nguyen decided to remove Flappy Bird from the App Store and Google Play in 2014, citing concerns about the game's addictive nature and the attention it was receiving. The game's removal led to a surge in popularity, with many people trying to download it before it was taken down. Flappy Bird remains a notable example of the unpredictable and sometimes controversial nature of mobile gaming.

**user:**

how many clone versions are there?

**assistant:**

The number of Flappy Bird clones is difficult to determine precisely because there were countless variations and replicas created by different developers after the original game was taken down. The simplicity of the gameplay mechanics made it relatively easy for other developers to create their own versions with slight variations or themes.

Many developers released Flappy Bird-inspired games with different characters, backgrounds, and obstacles. Some clones were created as a form of homage, while others were attempts to capitalize on the game's popularity.

Since the source code of Flappy Bird was not open to the public, many of these clones were built from scratch, replicating the core mechanics and design. As a result, it's challenging to provide an exact number of Flappy Bird clones, but there are certainly a large and diverse number of them available across various app stores and online platforms.

**user:**

what are the most successful spin off versions

**assistant:**

Identifying the "most successful" spin-off versions of Flappy Bird clones can be subjective and dependent on various factors such as download numbers, user reviews, and overall popularity. Additionally, the mobile gaming landscape is dynamic, and new games are frequently released. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have real-time data on specific spin-offs. However, I can mention a few notable spin-off versions that gained popularity:

1. **Splashy Fish:** This game is often mentioned as one of the successful Flappy Bird clones. It features a fish instead of a bird and follows a similar tap-to-jump mechanic.

2. **Swing Copters:** Created by Dong Nguyen, the developer of Flappy Bird, Swing Copters was seen as a spiritual successor. It maintained the simple control scheme but added vertical movement, making it more challenging.

3. **Flappy Dunk:** This spin-off combines the Flappy Bird concept with basketball. Players guide a basketball through a series of hoops by tapping to make it fly upwards.

4. **Ironpants:** While not an exact clone, Ironpants shares the same one-tap control style. Instead of navigating through pipes, players control a character flying through a series of obstacles.

Remember that the popularity of mobile games can change rapidly, and new games may have emerged since my last update. Additionally, individual preferences play a significant role in determining what one considers a "successful" spin-off.

**user:**

I want to make my own called fatty fart boy that features a fat man in a speedo, swimming through obstacles.  the characters depth in the water will be determined by the user tapping the screen and making the character fart, releasing air bubbles and decreasing his pressure.
