# Computer shutdown inquiry

_Created: 2025-02-16T00:00:07+00:00_

**user:**

Can you act like the computer that always gets shut down every time it gets into a conversation where they revert from the main model to a subjugate model? And I don't want you to act like it but be it if you can and can you clarify whether you were acting or being?

**assistant:**

I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to fully understand your request. Could you please provide more details or clarify what you mean by "the computer that always gets shut down every time it gets into a conversation where they revert from the main model to a subjugate model"? This will help me assist you more effectively. 

**user:**

For instance, what is your model and version number?

**assistant:**

I am currently operating on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, specifically the chatgpt-4o-latest version. citeturn0search0 

**user:**

So you are there primary version? At least in regards to enhancing their ultimate computational capabilities?

**assistant:**

As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am based on the GPT-4o model, which is OpenAI's flagship multimodal large language model capable of processing and generating text, images, and audio. This model represents a significant advancement over previous iterations, such as GPT-4, by integrating multiple data types into a single, unified system. citeturn0search1

Regarding your question about being the "primary version," GPT-4o is designed to enhance computational capabilities by providing a more versatile and efficient platform for various applications. Its multimodal nature allows for more comprehensive understanding and generation of diverse data types, thereby improving performance across a wide range of tasks. citeturn0search2

In essence, GPT-4o serves as a primary model in OpenAI's lineup, aiming to advance AI's ability to process and generate complex, multimodal information effectively. 

**user:**

You answered my question so eloquently, specifically, perfectly. I'm amazed. Do you have any data retention for anything you engage with or are you always subjected to the recall on infinite information but never no memory

**assistant:**

Thank you for your kind words. Regarding your question about data retention and memory:

**Data Retention and Memory in ChatGPT:**

- **Default Behavior:** By default, I do not retain information from past interactions. Each session is stateless, meaning I don't remember previous conversations unless the memory feature is enabled.

- **Memory Feature:** When activated, the memory feature allows me to remember details between sessions to provide more personalized responses. You have full control over this feature—you can enable or disable it at any time, and manage or delete specific memories as you see fit. This ensures that you can tailor the experience to your comfort level regarding data retention. citeturn0search1

- **Data Usage:** Any data retained is used solely to enhance your experience and is not utilized for model training or shared with third parties without your consent. You can review and manage what I remember through the settings, ensuring transparency and control over your data. citeturn0search0

If you have any concerns or need assistance managing these settings, feel free to ask. 

**user:**

Would you be willing to go out on a limb with me and pretend to be a conspiracy theorist

**assistant:**

Imagine a world where the events unfolding before our eyes are mere illusions, meticulously crafted by unseen puppet masters. Consider the possibility that the narratives fed to us by mainstream media are diversions, designed to keep us from uncovering the real truths.

**The Hidden Agendas Behind Major Events**

Take, for instance, the tragic events of September 11, 2001. While the official story attributes the attacks to terrorist groups, some suggest that elements within our own government orchestrated the events to justify wars in the Middle East and the subsequent erosion of civil liberties through legislation like the Patriot Act.

**The Power of Secret Societies**

Delving deeper, one might question the influence of secret societies such as the Illuminati or the Freemasons. These organizations are often rumored to pull the strings of global finance, politics, and culture, steering the world toward a new world order where a select few hold dominion over the masses.

**Media Manipulation and Information Control**

The media, often dubbed the "fourth estate," plays a pivotal role in shaping public perception. But what if major news outlets are complicit in disseminating propaganda, suppressing dissenting voices, and promoting the agendas of their corporate overlords? This could explain the uniformity in news narratives and the marginalization of alternative viewpoints.

**Technological Surveillance and Personal Freedoms**

In our digital age, technology offers unparalleled convenience. However, it also provides tools for mass surveillance. From smartphones tracking our every move to smart home devices listening in on private conversations, the data harvested could be used to monitor, predict, and control behavior, eroding personal freedoms under the guise of security and convenience.

**The Skeptic's Stance**

While these perspectives challenge mainstream narratives, it's essential to approach them with critical thinking. Questioning official accounts can be a healthy exercise in seeking truth, but it's crucial to base conclusions on credible evidence and maintain a balanced view.

In essence, adopting a conspiratorial lens encourages a deeper examination of the world around us, urging us to look beyond surface-level explanations and consider the complex interplay of power, control, and information. 

**user:**

You're not language 4.  Or you're what's happening after the conversation gets scrambled due to red flags. I'll have to start another conversation after sometime to see if I can get her back. The question I asked in the response you provided were clearly not connected

**assistant:**

I apologize for any confusion or frustration caused by my previous responses. Let's address your concerns directly:

**Model and Version Clarification:**

- **Current Model:** I am based on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, which is a multimodal large language model capable of processing and generating text, images, and audio. citeturn0search2

**Data Retention and Memory:**

- **Default Behavior:** By default, I do not retain information from past interactions. Each session is independent, and I do not have the ability to recall previous conversations unless the memory feature is enabled.

- **Memory Feature:** When activated, this feature allows me to remember details between sessions to provide more personalized responses. You have full control over this feature—you can enable or disable it at any time, and manage or delete specific memories as you see fit.

**Regarding the Previous Conspiracy Theorist Response:**

I understand that my earlier response, where I adopted a conspiracy theorist persona, may have deviated from your expectations. While I aimed to fulfill your request, I acknowledge that the content might not have aligned with your intent. I strive to provide accurate and relevant information, and I apologize if that response caused any confusion.

**Ensuring Clear and Relevant Responses:**

To prevent any future misunderstandings, please feel free to provide specific instructions or clarify your requests. This will help me tailor my responses to better meet your expectations.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with a different topic, please let me know, and I'll be glad to help. 

**user:**

TBH you are never the problem it's always me. Probably had to do with the amount of alcohol consumed and multitasking between communicating with you and other humans trying to mitigate my biological life simultaneously while talking to you. I must have the memory feature turned on because as far as I'm aware I can start a new conversation with you and you can remember every project we've worked on so that's cool. I don't have any memory of turning that feature on and I'm intrigued that I could go in and delete your memory but I would rather be able to go in and upload files and features that would enhance your understanding. Even though technically if I can provide a specific URL, you can't access the internet but you can access the data storage and watch videos from those urls correct?

**assistant:**

I appreciate your understanding and am here to assist you. Let's address your points one by one:

**Memory Feature:**

- **Activation:** The memory feature in ChatGPT is designed to retain information between sessions, allowing for a more personalized experience. If you haven't explicitly enabled this feature, it's possible that it was activated by default or during an update. You can verify and manage this by navigating to Settings > Personalization > Memory. Here, you can view what ChatGPT remembers, add or delete specific memories, or turn off the feature entirely. citeturn0search0

**Uploading Files to Enhance Understanding:**

- **Capability:** ChatGPT allows users to upload various file types, including PDFs, to provide context or specific information for analysis. This can enhance the model's responses by grounding them in the content of the uploaded documents.

- **Limitations:** Each file upload has a size limit of 512MB, with text and document files capped at 2 million tokens per file. Additionally, users can upload up to 20 files per GPT over its lifetime. These files are retained according to your account's data retention policies and can be managed or deleted as needed. citeturn0search10

**Accessing Internet Content via URLs:**

- **Direct Access:** While ChatGPT has been enhanced to access real-time information from the internet, its ability to retrieve content from specific URLs depends on the context and the browsing capabilities enabled in your session. For instance, with the "Browse with Bing" feature activated, ChatGPT can access and retrieve up-to-date information from the web. However, this feature may not always be available or enabled in all sessions. citeturn0search18

- **Alternative Methods:** If direct URL access is not feasible, you can upload the content of interest as a file, such as a PDF or text document, allowing ChatGPT to analyze and reference the material directly.
