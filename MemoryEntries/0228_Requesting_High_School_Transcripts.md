**user:**

My friend attended grossmont college in San Diego many years ago when she first immigrated to the United states. They should have her transcripts original high school transcripts available correct? She requires those now that she is applying for University after attending a private institution for dental hygiene in attempts to pursue her career as a DDS oral surgeon/md eventually. What or who would she contact in order to have those transcripts sent over to Cal State San Marcos?

**assistant:**

Grossmont College does not retain original high school transcripts submitted during the admissions process. Therefore, your friend will need to request her high school transcripts directly from her former high school or the relevant educational authority in her home country.

To proceed with her application to California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), she should contact the Office of Admissions to inquire about acceptable alternatives if obtaining the original high school transcripts is challenging. They may offer guidance on how to fulfill the transcript requirement under such circumstances.

Here is the contact information for CSUSM's Office of Admissions:

- **Phone:** (760) 750-4848
- **Email:** apply@csusm.edu

For further assistance, your friend can also reach out to Grossmont College's Admissions and Records office:

My friend was an international transfer student. She had recently immigrated from afghanistan. They still would not have her record on file?

**assistant:**

If your friend was an international transfer student at Grossmont College, they **might** still have her high school transcript or academic documents on file, depending on how long ago she attended and the college’s retention policies. However, many institutions do not retain international transcripts indefinitely or return them after the admission process is complete.

Here’s what you can recommend to her:

1. **Contact Grossmont College Admissions and Records:**  
   - They can confirm whether her international transcript is still on file or if it was returned to her.  
   - **Contact Information:**  
     - Phone: (619) 644-7186  
     - Email: grossmont.admissions@gcccd.edu  

2. **Request a Verification:**  
   - If they no longer have her original high school transcript, Grossmont can at least provide **proof of her attendance** or any academic records, which may help supplement her university application.  
   
3. **Alternative Options:**  
   - If Grossmont does not have the transcript, she can try contacting her high school or Afghanistan’s Ministry of Education for a reissue of the document.  
   - If obtaining the transcript is difficult, **CSUSM Admissions** may allow alternate documentation, such as a statement of education, diploma copies, or a letter from Grossmont.

It’s best for her to first verify Grossmont’s records before exploring further steps.
