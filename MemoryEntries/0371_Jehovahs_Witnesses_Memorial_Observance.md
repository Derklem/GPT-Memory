As an AI language model, I don't have access to current or future events, including specific holiday dates, as my knowledge cutoff is in September 2021. However, Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate holidays related to Jesus' death, such as Good Friday or Easter, as they do not believe in the observance of these holidays. They believe that Jesus' death should be commemorated and remembered throughout the year, rather than on a specific day or during a specific holiday. Jehovah's Witnesses typically observe the anniversary of Jesus' death, known as the Memorial or the Lord's Evening Meal, on the date of the Jewish calendar equivalent to the 14th day of Nisan, which usually falls in March or April. It is typically observed after sunset in the evening, as per their beliefs. It's important to consult with local Jehovah's Witness communities or their official website for the most accurate and up-to-date information on their holiday observances.
