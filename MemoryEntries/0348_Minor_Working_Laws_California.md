In California, if a privately owned liquor store is found to be employing an underage person to handle liquor, it can result in penalties and consequences for the store. The specific penalties can vary depending on the circumstances and the severity of the violation. Here are some potential consequences that may apply:

1. Administrative Penalties: The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) is responsible for regulating the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. If a violation is discovered, the ABC can impose administrative penalties on the store. These penalties may include fines, suspension, or revocation of the store's liquor license.

2. Criminal Charges: In some cases, if the violation is severe or repeated, criminal charges may be filed against the store owner or responsible parties. Criminal charges can result in fines, probation, or even imprisonment, depending on the severity of the offense.

3. Legal Proceedings: Violations related to underage handling of liquor can lead to legal proceedings. The store owner may need to appear in court and face legal consequences. This can involve legal fees, court costs, and other associated expenses.

4. Reputation and Business Impact: Violations of this nature can significantly harm the reputation and business of the liquor store. Negative publicity and loss of customer trust can have long-lasting effects on the store's profitability and sustainability.

It's important to note that the penalties and consequences may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case, the prior compliance history of the store, and any aggravating or mitigating factors. It's advisable for store owners to strictly adhere to the laws and regulations regarding the employment of minors and the sale of alcoholic beverages to avoid such penalties and legal issues.
