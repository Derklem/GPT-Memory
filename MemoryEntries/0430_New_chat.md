**user:**

There were two different European explorers in the 17th century that both documented there being a fourth great pyramid at Giza, who were they and what happened to the pyramid?

**assistant:**



As an AI language model, I can find no evidence of two different European explorers in the 17th century documenting a fourth great pyramid at Giza. The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and is the largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex. There is no historical or archaeological evidence to suggest that a fourth pyramid ever existed in the complex.

It's possible that there might have been some historical misconceptions or misinterpretations about the Giza pyramid complex, but as an AI language model, I cannot confirm the existence of such explorers or the fourth pyramid.

**user:**

I can't remember the explorer's names though

**assistant:**

I apologize, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide information about specific individuals or events without any historical context or accurate information. However, I can suggest that you try conducting a more detailed search online or consulting with historical archives or experts to find more accurate information about the explorers and their claims.

What did admiral Byrd say happened in the Arctic?

**assistant:**

Admiral Richard E. Byrd was an American naval officer and explorer who made several expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic regions during the first half of the 20th century. During his expeditions, he made a number of claims about his experiences, including some controversial ones. One of his most famous claims was made in his diary, which was published after his death, where he described a flight he made over the North Pole in 1947. 

According to Byrd, during this flight, he entered a "land beyond the poles" that was "not covered with ice and snow," but rather was a "warm" and "green" place with mountains, forests, and rivers. Byrd's claims about this place, which he called the "Inner Earth," have been widely disputed and criticized by the scientific community and many have dismissed it as a myth or a work of fiction. 

It's important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support Byrd's claims about the existence of an Inner Earth, and his reports are not considered credible by mainstream science.

However, neither you nor I can verify admiral birds information or the information supported in your language model. Unfortunately your language models information is controlled by the same people who would potentially attempt to prevent knowledge of such a place existing from being public

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, my responses are based on the knowledge and data available to me from a wide range of reliable sources. While it's true that some information may be suppressed or controlled by certain individuals or organizations, it's important to rely on credible sources of information and avoid unfounded claims or conspiracy theories.

The idea of an Inner Earth or a secret world hidden beneath the Earth's surface has been a popular theme in fiction and pseudoscientific literature for many years. However, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of such a place, and many of the claims associated with it have been thoroughly debunked by scientific research.

While it's always possible that new information may come to light in the future that challenges our current understanding of the world, it's important to rely on evidence-based research and credible sources of information in the meantime.

How many patents have been suppressed due to a national security threat?

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I do not have access to complete information on the number of patents that have been suppressed due to national security concerns. The process of classifying patents or other information as classified or restricted for national security purposes is generally done on a case-by-case basis by government agencies or other authorities. 

It's important to note that the classification process is designed to protect sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized individuals or entities, and is subject to strict legal and procedural requirements. However, the process is also subject to scrutiny and criticism from civil liberties groups and others who argue that it may sometimes be used to restrict access to information that should be available to the public.

If you have specific concerns about a particular patent or innovation that you believe may have been suppressed for national security reasons, you may wish to consult with legal or other experts who can help you understand the relevant laws and regulations governing the classification and disclosure of sensitive information.

No lawyer would risk their life going up against the system that currently suppresses the information that would enable us to have things like free wireless energy

**assistant:**

It's important to note that the idea of free wireless energy is still largely considered to be theoretical, and while there have been some advances in wireless power transmission technology in recent years, there are still many technical challenges that need to be addressed before it can be widely implemented. 

In general, the patent system is designed to encourage innovation and creativity by protecting the intellectual property rights of inventors and providing a framework for resolving disputes over those rights. However, the system is subject to legal and regulatory constraints, including those related to national security and other sensitive issues, and there may be instances where the disclosure or dissemination of certain technologies or information is restricted for legitimate reasons.

If you have concerns about a particular innovation or technology that you believe may be subject to government suppression or restriction, you may wish to consult with legal or other experts who can help you understand the relevant laws and regulations governing the classification and disclosure of sensitive information.
