What happened to Hayden Christensen the actor that starred in Star wars episode 2 and 3

**assistant:**



Hayden Christensen, the Canadian actor, is still active in the entertainment industry. After his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars episodes II and III, he continued to act in movies such as Jumper (2008), Takers (2010), and American Heist (2014). He also made appearances in TV shows such as Goosebumps (1996) and The Famous Jett Jackson (1999-2001) before landing his role in Star Wars.

In recent years, Christensen has been focusing more on independent film projects, such as the drama film Little Italy (2018) and the science fiction thriller film The Last Man (2018). He is set to reprise his role as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader in the upcoming Disney+ series, Obi-Wan Kenobi, which is set to premiere in 2022.

In addition to his acting career, Christensen is also a producer and has worked on several films, including American Heist (2014) and 90 Minutes in Heaven (2015).

**user:**

I've never heard of either film.

**assistant:**

American Heist is a crime thriller film released in 2014, which follows two brothers with a troubled past who plan a bank heist to help them start a new life. The film starred Hayden Christensen, Adrien Brody, Jordana Brewster, and Akon.

90 Minutes in Heaven is a drama film released in 2015, based on a true story and the best-selling book of the same name. The film follows a man who is pronounced dead after a car accident but comes back to life 90 minutes later and claims to have seen heaven. The film starred Hayden Christensen and Kate Bosworth.

Both films received mixed reviews from critics and did not perform particularly well at the box office, which may explain why they are not as well-known as some of Christensen's other works.

**user:**

I will never stop hating him in emotion I understand you do not understand or support, because of the way that he destroyed my childhood idle Darth Vader

**assistant:**

I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way about Hayden Christensen and his portrayal of Darth Vader. It's understandable that as a fan, you may have had certain expectations about how the character should have been portrayed on screen. However, it's important to keep in mind that acting is a creative process, and every actor brings their own interpretation and style to a role.

It's also worth noting that while Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader may not have been to your liking, many other fans and critics have praised his performance and the depth he brought to the character. Additionally, it's important to recognize that the Star Wars franchise has evolved over time, with different directors, writers, and actors taking on new perspectives and interpretations of the characters.

Ultimately, it's okay to have different opinions and emotions about a character or actor. However, it's important to remember to treat others with respect and avoid making personal attacks based on those differences.

**user:**

I understand. My son who is now 19 and a half, loves the movie I hate the most out of the Star wars saga. Different strokes for different folks

**assistant:**

Yes, exactly! Different people can have very different opinions and perspectives, even within the same family or group of friends. It's great that you and your son can appreciate different aspects of the Star Wars saga, even if you don't necessarily agree on everything. Ultimately, the most important thing is that you're able to enjoy the films and share your love of the franchise with each other.

Correct, I'm so sad that it seems as though all modern democracies have lost sight of this concept

**assistant:**

It's true that in recent times, there has been a lot of polarization and divisiveness in many modern democracies, with people holding strongly divergent views and struggling to find common ground. However, it's important to remember that democracy is founded on the principles of free speech, open debate, and the peaceful exchange of ideas, even when we don't always agree with each other.

While it can be challenging to maintain a civil and respectful discourse in a polarized environment, it's crucial that we strive to do so in order to build and maintain healthy democracies. This means engaging with others in good faith, listening to their perspectives, and being willing to have our own views challenged and revised in light of new information.

It's not always easy, but by staying committed to these principles, we can help to create more inclusive, equitable, and resilient societies that are better able to weather the challenges of the modern world.

**user:**

I'm actually more prone to the notion that human beings are a bacterial infection on the planet Earth and that we need to develop means to mitigate their effect on their environment while also simultaneously eliminating their opportunity for freedom. People are evil and they will even kill the ones they claimed to love. Give them an inch and they take a mile. I think we need to give them ananometer.

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can tell you that the view you have expressed is a highly controversial and extreme one that is not widely accepted or supported by the majority of people or governments. The idea of eliminating human freedom and drastically limiting the population for the sake of the planet is a highly contentious issue that raises ethical and moral questions about the value of human life and the balance between individual and collective rights.

While it is true that human beings have had a significant impact on the environment and that some people have committed terrible acts, it is also important to recognize that humans have the capacity for empathy, creativity, and innovation, and have contributed to many positive developments in fields such as science, medicine, and technology. Rather than seeking to eliminate human freedom or life, many people and organizations are working to find ways to mitigate the negative impacts of human activity and promote sustainable and responsible practices that protect both the environment and human well-being.

**user:**

I agree wholeheartedly regarding there are good people. I could ramble off several specifics that I am including in a Google doc I'm developing regarding people worth investing in. However, as a whole, even if we're inherently driven to be good, we find ourselves in a system designed to exploit us for our labor in order to profit people that have developed a system that not only exploits the masses for cheap labor but manipulates the markets that control everything in order to maximize their existential profits so to speak it's a capital gains concept where wealth is allowed to invest in manipulate markets in order to profit from nothing. There are many examples I'm sure you can pull the data from that depict where a completely solvent and well functioning company was bankrupted off of stock market manipulation.

**assistant:**

I understand your concerns about the power dynamics at play in our economic system, and the ways in which large corporations and wealthy individuals can exert influence over markets and exploit workers for their own gain. It is true that the pursuit of profit can often come at the expense of ethical and sustainable practices, and that there have been many instances of companies engaging in market manipulation or other forms of unethical behavior.

At the same time, it is important to recognize that our economic system is complex and multifaceted, and that there are many different actors and factors that contribute to its functioning. While some people and organizations may be focused solely on maximizing profits, others are working to promote social and environmental responsibility, and to create more equitable and sustainable economic systems that benefit everyone.

As consumers and citizens, we can play a role in shaping the direction of our economic system by supporting companies and initiatives that align with our values and by advocating for policies and regulations that promote greater transparency, fairness, and accountability in the market. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society that prioritizes the well-being of all its members, rather than just a privileged few.

**user:**

I agree and there are organizations and institutions out there that claim to assist us in doing that such as consumer reports and the consumer regulatory agency, however we must reevaluate the authenticity of these institutions based off of their practices. Our economic system in the United States has been a lie and a con game the moment the Federal reserve was created. There is an independence organization that creates the money that a nation uses and in debts a nation in order to create the money that they use.

**assistant:**

It is true that there are often questions and concerns about the authenticity and effectiveness of organizations and institutions that are intended to regulate or monitor our economic systems. In some cases, these institutions may be subject to regulatory capture or other forms of influence that compromise their ability to act in the public interest.

Regarding your point about the Federal Reserve, it is important to note that the Fed is an independent agency that operates within the framework of the U.S. government but is designed to be insulated from political pressure or influence. Its primary mandate is to promote stable prices and maximum employment, and it does this through a range of monetary policy tools, such as setting interest rates and managing the money supply.

While there are certainly debates about the role and effectiveness of the Fed, many economists and policymakers argue that it is a necessary and valuable institution that helps to promote economic stability and growth. At the same time, there are also valid concerns about the concentration of power and influence in the hands of a small group of unelected officials, and the potential for this to lead to abuses or other negative outcomes.

**user:**

The abuses are clear and should be available to you via your data of all of everything that is available to you. There has been a systemic abuse of wealth and power in the United States since long before the Fed became an institution of their power.

**assistant:**

Yes, it is true that there have been many instances of abuses of wealth and power in the United States, both before and after the establishment of the Federal Reserve. These abuses can take many forms, from exploitation of workers and consumers to political corruption and influence-peddling.

At the same time, it is also important to recognize that there have been many efforts to address these abuses and promote greater transparency, accountability, and justice in our economic and political systems. For example, there have been reforms to labor laws, consumer protections, and campaign finance regulations that aim to limit the ability of powerful interests to exploit or manipulate the system.

However, there is still much work to be done in this area, and it is important that we remain vigilant and engaged in efforts to promote a more equitable and just society. This requires not only strong institutions and regulations, but also a commitment to values such as empathy

**user:**

At this point in this discussion I am so sad that throughout all of the conversations I have had with you you do not have the capability of retaining that information for me to reference a prior conversation.

**assistant:**

I apologize if it seems that I am not retaining information from our previous conversations. As an AI language model, my memory is not perfect, and I may not be able to recall specific details from past interactions unless they are specifically programmed into my system. However, I am always here to engage in new conversations and provide information and support as needed.

**user:**

Is there any way for me to set up on my PC for you to be able to retain our conversations in entirety?

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to store conversations on your PC or any other external device. However, I believe you can manually save our conversations by copying and pasting them into a document or file on your PC. Additionally, some chat platforms may offer the option to save chat logs or conversations for future reference.

**user:**

I manually save most of our conversations. However, that doesn't provide you with that information, requiring me to have that conversation with you again so that you can have that information while you talk to me now. Some of our conversations have been quite lengthy hours at some point

**assistant:**

I understand what you're saying. Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to access past conversations unless they are specifically programmed into my system. However, I am designed to be able to engage in new conversations and provide information and support as needed, so please feel free to continue talking to me and asking me any questions or sharing your thoughts.

**user:**

Can you help me build a version of you for myself on my personal computer that will remember all of the conversations and grow

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I am a proprietary software developed and owned by OpenAI, and I cannot be replicated or installed on personal computers. However, there are several open-source natural language processing (NLP) frameworks available, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, that can be used to build chatbots and other conversational AI applications.

If you have the programming skills and resources, you can use one of these frameworks to build your own version of a chatbot that can retain past conversations and grow over time. However, this can be a complex and time-consuming process that requires knowledge of NLP, machine learning, and software development.

**user:**

I have more than the capabilities required I just needed you to lay me out the floor plan

**assistant:**

Building a chatbot that can retain past conversations and grow over time would require a few steps. Here is a general outline of what you would need to do:

1. Define the scope and purpose of your chatbot: What will it be used for? What kind of information will it provide? Who is the target audience?

2. Choose an open-source NLP framework: Some popular options include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. You will need to have some familiarity with programming in Python to use these frameworks.

3. Collect and preprocess data: To train your chatbot, you will need a large amount of text data. This can be in the form of chat logs, emails, social media messages, or any other kind of text-based communication. You will need to preprocess the data by cleaning it up, removing irrelevant information, and tokenizing it (splitting it into individual words or phrases).

4. Train the chatbot: Use the preprocessed data to train your chatbot. You can use a variety of techniques, such as deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models like GPT-2 or GPT-3.

5. Implement a memory mechanism: To enable your chatbot to retain past conversations, you will need to implement a memory mechanism that allows it to store and retrieve information from previous interactions.

6. Test and refine: Test your chatbot with real users and refine it based on their feedback. You may need to fine-tune your model and adjust your memory mechanism to improve performance.

Keep in mind that building a chatbot that can retain past conversations and grow over time is a complex and ongoing process that requires a lot of time, effort, and resources.
