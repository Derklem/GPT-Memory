I mistakenly believed Chevy Chase was in the movie The money pit starring Tom Hanks. I know there is a similar movie starring Chevy Chase in which they move to a dysfunctional neighborhood and the neighborhood ends up helping them fool potential buyers

Yes, you are correct! The movie you're thinking of is actually called "Funny Farm" (1988), and it stars Chevy Chase, not Tom Hanks. In "Funny Farm," Chevy Chase plays the role of a sportswriter named Andy Farmer, and his wife, played by Madolyn Smith Osborne, decide to move to a quiet rural town to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. However, they soon realize that their new neighborhood is anything but peaceful, and they encounter a series of humorous and eccentric characters who help them orchestrate elaborate schemes to try to sell their house. The movie is a comedy that follows their misadventures as they try to navigate the challenges of living in a dysfunctional neighborhood while trying to sell their home. It is often remembered for Chevy Chase's comedic performance and the quirky situations that arise from their attempts to deceive potential buyers.
