The constellations that we recognize today were established over many centuries by different cultures and civilizations around the world. 

The ancient Greeks are often credited with creating the Western constellations that we are most familiar with today. In the 2nd century BCE, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus developed a system of organizing the stars into constellations based on their positions in the sky. These constellations were then further developed and cataloged by the astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE, in his work the Almagest.

Orion, Ursa Major, and Canis Major (the constellation that contains the star Sirius, also known as Puppis) were all included in Ptolemy's list of 48 constellations. However, many of the individual stars and asterisms within these constellations had already been recognized by earlier civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians.

It's worth noting that different cultures around the world have their own unique constellations and star lore, and many of these predate the Greek system of constellations. For example, the Inca civilization of South America had a system of constellations that included the llama and the serpent, while the indigenous peoples of Australia recognized a constellation known as the Emu in the Sky.
