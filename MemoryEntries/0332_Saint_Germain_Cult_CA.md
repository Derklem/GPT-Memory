I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information on a "Saint Germain cult" with the abbreviation "ca." Saint Germain is a figure who has been associated with various mystical and esoteric traditions, but there isn't a single "cult" dedicated to Saint Germain that is widely recognized or documented.

If you have more specific information or context about what you're looking for, please provide it, and I'll do my best to assist you further.

The Count of Saint Germain, also known as Comte de Saint Germain, is a mysterious historical figure who lived in the 18th century and is the subject of numerous legends and myths. He was known for his purported abilities in alchemy, music, and diplomacy, and many stories and claims surround his life.

While there is no single organization or institution directly associated with the historical Count of Saint Germain, he has become a prominent figure in various esoteric and mystical traditions, particularly in the realm of the occult and spiritualism. Some New Age and occult groups have adopted his name and persona, incorporating him into their beliefs and practices. These associations are often more symbolic or mythological in nature rather than historical.

For example, in the 19th and 20th centuries, various esoteric and mystical movements, such as Theosophy and the I AM Activity, have mentioned or drawn inspiration from the Count of Saint Germain in their teachings. These groups sometimes depict him as an ascended master or a spiritually advanced being.

It's important to note that much of the information and lore surrounding the Count of Saint Germain is based on legend and anecdote, and separating fact from fiction can be challenging. Therefore, any contemporary organizations or institutions associated with him are typically rooted in beliefs and interpretations rather than concrete historical evidence.
