**user:**

Could you help me build a game like flappy Bird

**assistant:**

Sure! To build a game like Flappy Bird, you will need to use a game development engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine. You can also use a programming language like C# or C++ to write the game from scratch. 

Here are some basic steps you can follow to build a simple version of the game:
1. Create a new project in your chosen game engine or set up a new project in your programming environment.
2. Create a 2D game environment with a background and a foreground.
3. Create a sprite for the bird and give it physics properties such as gravity.
4. Create obstacles, such as pipes, that the bird must fly between.
5. Write scripts to control the bird's movement and collision detection with the obstacles.
6. Create a scoring system that increases as the bird flies through the obstacles.
7. Add sound effects and music to enhance the game's atmosphere.
8. Test the game and make any necessary adjustments.

Please note that creating a game like flappy bird is not a trivial task, it requires good understanding of game development, programming and game engine.

I am not intimidated by the workload or the spectrum of requirements. I feel though that it is a simpler place to start rather than my initial idea

**assistant:**

Great! Building a game like Flappy Bird is a good starting point for learning game development. 

It is a relatively simple concept that can be broken down into manageable tasks. You can start by focusing on one aspect of the game at a time, such as creating the bird sprite or implementing the scoring system.

You can also find a lot of tutorials and resources online that can guide you through the process of building a Flappy Bird-like game.

What agency regulates the consideration of natural disasters occurring simultaneously. By this specifically I mean heavy rains followed by an earthquake or fires followed by heavy rains

**assistant:**

The agency that regulates the consideration of natural disasters occurring simultaneously can vary depending on the location and the specific type of disaster.

In the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for coordinating the response to natural disasters and providing assistance to affected individuals and communities. However, other agencies also play a role in disaster management, such as the National Weather Service (NWS) for severe weather events, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for earthquakes, and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) for wildfires.

At the state level, there are also emergency management agencies that work with local authorities and first responders to prepare for and respond to natural disasters.

In addition, other organizations such as the American Red Cross, National Guard, and other non-government organizations also play a role in disaster response.

It is important to note that when a natural disaster happens, different agencies work together, share information, and coordinate their activities to provide the best possible response.

It would be best to check with your local authorities on the agency in charge of your specific area and also consider preparing for multiple hazards by creating a emergency plan for you and your family, that way you can be ready for any type of natural disaster that may happen.

Which agency oversees that communication network between the other agencies

**assistant:**

In the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for coordinating the response to natural disasters and overseeing the communication network between the other agencies involved in the response.

FEMA acts as the primary point of contact between federal, state, and local agencies during a disaster, and it is responsible for ensuring that all agencies are working together effectively to respond to the crisis. This includes setting up and managing a Joint Field Office (JFO) or Emergency Operations Center (EOC) where representatives from various agencies can gather to share information and coordinate their activities. 

FEMA also has the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) and the Regional Response Coordination Center (RRCC) to coordinate the efforts of the federal government, state and local government, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations in response and recovery efforts. 

In addition to FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also plays a key role in disaster communication and coordination, particularly in regard to cyber and physical infrastructure protection.

It is important to remember that effective communication and coordination between agencies is critical in ensuring an efficient and effective response to natural disasters, which is why the role of the lead agency is key in this aspect.
