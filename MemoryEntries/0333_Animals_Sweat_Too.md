**user:**

Are there any other creatures besides human beings that perspire

**assistant:**

Yes, many animals perspire or sweat as a way to regulate their body temperature. Some examples include horses, cows, elephants, and certain species of primates. Additionally, some birds and even insects have mechanisms to release excess heat through similar processes, although they might not produce liquid sweat like humans do.
