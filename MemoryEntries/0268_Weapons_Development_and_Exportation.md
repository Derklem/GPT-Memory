Can you rewrite the lyrics for the song America fuck yeah from the movie team America by Matt Stone and Trey Parker that focuses solely upon our development of weapons and their exportation based off of their devastation

**assistant:**

Sure, here are rewritten lyrics focusing on the development and exportation of weapons and their devastation:

---

Weapons, hell yeah!
Coming from America to blow things away, yeah.
Weapons, hell yeah!
Making war's destruction our number one trade, yeah.

Missiles, guns, and drones galore,
Spreading chaos on foreign shores.
Weapons, hell yeah!
Arms deals, power plays, profits on display, yeah!

From our factories to the world,
Devastation flags unfurled.
Weapons, hell yeah!
War machines rolling out every day, yeah.

Explosions, hell yeah!
Turning cities into craters, nothing left to say, yeah.
Weapons, hell yeah!
Sending shockwaves, destruction, come what may, yeah.

Bombs dropping from the sky,
Innocence caught in the crossfire.
Weapons, hell yeah!
Forcing nations to comply, the price they pay, yeah!

Spreading terror, fueling fear,
As the smoke and rubble clear.
Weapons, hell yeah!
The dark side of progress, hear the cries of dismay, yeah.

Feel free to adjust as needed!
