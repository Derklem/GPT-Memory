I see who is the famous British actor that I imagine in a military garb with medals and a mullet

It is difficult to determine the exact actor you have in mind without more specific information. However, one actor who has played military roles and has had a mullet hairstyle in the past is Mel Gibson. He is an Australian-American actor and filmmaker who has starred in several war movies, including "We Were Soldiers" and "Braveheart." He has also won numerous awards for his acting, including two Academy Awards.

No this is an actual musician who is very successful who has been knighted. It's not David Bowie or Elton John,

**assistant:**

Based on the description you provided, the musician you might be thinking of who has been knighted and has worn a military-style jacket with medals in the past is Sir Rod Stewart.

He has sold over 250 million records worldwide and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. In the past, he has been photographed wearing a military-style jacket with medals, and he was knighted by Prince William in 2016 for his services to music and charity.
