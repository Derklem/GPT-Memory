Who were the Jackson 5 and how many Jackson children were there


**assistant:**

The Jackson 5 was an American pop music group that consisted of five brothers: Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael Jackson. The group was formed in 1964 in Gary, Indiana, and became one of the most successful and influential groups in the history of popular music. They were originally called The Jackson Brothers and later changed their name to The Jackson 5.

The group's early success came with Motown Records, where they scored several hit singles such as "ABC," "I Want You Back," and "Never Can Say Goodbye." The Jackson 5's music was a blend of pop, soul, and R&B, and they were known for their catchy melodies, tight harmonies, and energetic stage performances.

Michael Jackson later went on to become one of the most successful solo artists in history, but the Jackson 5 continued to perform and record music throughout the 1970s. In total, there were 10 Jackson children, including the five members of the Jackson 5.

Did all 10 children share the same parents

**assistant:**

Yes, all 10 children of the Jackson family shared the same parents. Their parents were Joseph Walter Jackson and Katherine Esther Scruse. Joseph was a talent manager and musician, and he was instrumental in the early success of the Jackson 5. Katherine was a homemaker and was known for her role in supporting her children's music careers. The Jackson family grew up in a small house in Gary, Indiana, and faced many challenges on their road to success, but they remained close-knit and supportive of each other throughout their lives.
