Who developed the 60 second 60 minute 24-hour schedule

**assistant:**



The 60-second minute, 60-minute hour, and 24-hour day are all based on the ancient Babylonian system of time measurement, which was later adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans. The use of this system was widespread in Europe and much of the world for many centuries, and it continues to be used today. The modern concept of time zones was developed in the 19th century to standardize timekeeping across the globe.

**user:**

Can you tell me more about how the Babylonians arrived at this form of measurement? Also, how does it relate to the Inca Maya omec calendar which was based off of the 260-day calendar

**assistant:**

The Babylonians used a sexagesimal (base-60) number system for their calculations, which may have been based on the number of joints in the fingers of both hands. This system allowed them to easily divide a day into smaller units, such as hours, minutes, and seconds, by dividing it into 24 hours of 60 minutes each. 

The Babylonians also used a calendar that was based on the cycles of the Moon, which lasted approximately 29.5 days. They used a system of intercalation, adding an extra month periodically to keep their calendar in line with the seasons. The Babylonian calendar was adopted by the Greeks and Romans, and eventually evolved into the Gregorian calendar that is widely used today.

The Inca and Maya calendars were based on astronomical observations and were used to track the cycles of the Sun, Moon, and planets. The Inca calendar consisted of a 365-day solar year, divided into 12 months, while the Maya calendar was based on a 260-day cycle called the Tzolkin, which was used for divination and religious ceremonies. The Maya also used a 365-day solar calendar, as well as a Long Count calendar that could track dates over thousands of years. While these calendars were different from the Babylonian system of time measurement, they also played important roles in the daily lives of these ancient civilizations.

What about ancient Hindus?

**assistant:**

Ancient Hindu civilization also had its own unique system of time measurement. The earliest known Hindu calendar is the Vedic calendar, which dates back to the 2nd millennium BCE. The Vedic calendar was based on the phases of the Moon and the movement of the Sun, and it divided the year into 12 lunar months of 29 or 30 days each.

Over time, the Hindu calendar evolved and became more complex. The Surya Siddhanta, a text on astronomy and timekeeping, was written around the 5th century CE and introduced the use of the solar cycle in Hindu timekeeping. This led to the development of the Saka calendar, which is still used in India today.

The Saka calendar is a lunisolar calendar that takes into account the movement of the Sun and the Moon. It consists of 12 lunar months and is based on the position of the Sun relative to the zodiac. The Hindu calendar also includes a number of festivals and holy days, many of which are based on astronomical events.

In addition to the lunar and solar calendars, the ancient Hindus also developed a system of time measurement known as the yuga cycle. The yuga cycle consists of four ages, or yugas, that follow each other in a cyclical pattern. The current age, according to Hindu tradition, is the Kali Yuga, which is believed to be a time of spiritual decline and moral decay.

**user:**

So the 365 day calendar and the division of ours to minutes and minutes to seconds division of 60 all correlates back to the revolutions of the Earth around the Sun regardless of the culture which were referencing

**assistant:**

Yes, that's correct. The adoption of a 365-day year and the division of a day into hours, minutes, and seconds were based on the astronomical observations of the movements of the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon, which were consistent across different cultures and civilizations. The 365-day year corresponds roughly to the time it takes for the Earth to make one orbit around the Sun, while the 24-hour day corresponds roughly to the time it takes for the Earth to make one rotation on its axis. The division of time into minutes and seconds was based on the sexagesimal (base-60) number system, which was widely used in the ancient world. While different cultures had their own unique systems of timekeeping and calendars, many of them were based on these astronomical observations and shared similar principles.
