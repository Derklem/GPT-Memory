**user:**

How many popes have there been in total?

**assistant:**

There have been a total of 266 popes in the history of the Catholic Church, including the current pope, Pope Francis. The first pope, Saint Peter, was appointed by Jesus Christ himself and served as the Bishop of Rome in the first century A.D. Since then, the office of the papacy has been held by a succession of popes, each with their own unique contributions to the Church and its history.

**user:**

How many Pope names are there? By this I mean you said that there have been 12 Pope pius's, how many total Pope names are there that constitute the 266 total popes

**assistant:**

There is no set number of names that a pope can choose from when he is elected, and popes are free to choose any name they wish. However, there are certain names that have been used more frequently throughout history, such as John, Benedict, Gregory, and Pius.

In addition to these more commonly used names, there have been a wide variety of other names used by popes over the centuries, including some quite unusual ones. For example, Pope Lando, who served in the 10th century, was the only pope in history to have that name. Similarly, there have been a few popes who took on unique names like Pope Hilarius, Pope Liberius, and Pope Simplicius.

Overall, while there are certain names that have been more popular among popes, the number of possible names a pope can choose from is essentially limitless, and each pope has the freedom to choose a name that holds special meaning to them or that they feel represents their vision for their papacy.

**user:**
