How many people have been into space what were their names and when did they go from the United States

**assistant:**

As of 2024, over 360 astronauts from the United States have flown into space, with missions spanning from the 1960s to recent years. These astronauts have participated in various programs, including the Apollo missions, the Space Shuttle program, and missions to the International Space Station (ISS). 

The first U.S. astronaut to fly in space was **Alan Shepard** in 1961 aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3, followed by **John Glenn**, who became the first American to orbit Earth in 1962. Notable missions also include the Moon landings, starting with **Neil Armstrong** and **Buzz Aldrin** in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the Space Shuttle program greatly expanded the number of American astronauts flying into space. This period saw contributions from individuals like **Sally Ride** (the first American woman in space) and **Guion Bluford** (the first African American in space). 

In recent years, American astronauts have traveled to space through NASA’s collaborations with international partners and private companies like SpaceX. For example, the recent Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon, with astronauts like **Jessica Meir** and **Christina Koch** preparing for future missions【6†source】【7†source】.

If you need a complete list of all astronauts and their specific mission dates, the NASA Astronaut Fact Book or websites like Cosmos Book can provide detailed data.

When did Allen Glenn go to space

**assistant:**

It seems like there might be a mix-up—there is no astronaut named *Allen Glenn*. You might be referring to **John Glenn**, the first American to orbit the Earth. 

John Glenn flew into space on **February 20, 1962**, aboard the Mercury-Atlas 6 mission, becoming a national hero and a symbol of American spaceflight during the early space race. His spacecraft, *Friendship 7*, completed three orbits around the Earth.

Remarkably, Glenn returned to space many years later at the age of 77, flying on the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-95) on **October 29, 1998**, making him the oldest person to fly into space【6†source】【7†source】.
