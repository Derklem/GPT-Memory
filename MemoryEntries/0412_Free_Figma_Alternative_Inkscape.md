I thought react native was a program that would assist me in understanding and developing code. From what I can tell it is simply a web page that contains all of the information regarding understanding and implementing code.

**assistant:**

React Native is a framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to use a single codebase to create apps for multiple platforms, such as iOS and Android, while still achieving a native look and feel. It's not just a web page with information, it's a full-fledged development framework that can be used to build actual mobile apps.

**user:**

To build that mobile app I would need to write a text document correct? I don't see anywhere on the web page where I'm able to create

**assistant:**

To build a mobile app with React Native, you need to write code in a text editor. React Native uses JavaScript, and you can use various text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) to write and edit your code.

You can find a number of tutorials and resources online that can help you get started with React Native development, but you'll need to have some understanding of JavaScript and basic programming concepts to be able to effectively use React Native to build an app.
