**user:**

I currently use inkscape on my computer. I am being lazy and want to be able to use my phone and finger to draw up a rough design for a new Ouija board. What application would work best for me on my phone with my finger

**assistant:**



There are many different drawing applications available for mobile phones that allow you to use your finger to create rough designs. Here are a few options that you might find helpful:

1. Adobe Illustrator Draw: This is a free drawing app that allows you to create vector graphics using your finger. It has many of the same features as Inkscape, such as layers and the ability to draw shapes, lines, and curves.

2. SketchBook: SketchBook is a popular drawing app that is available on both iOS and Android. It has a wide variety of brushes and tools that you can use to create your design, and it also supports layers.

3. Procreate Pocket: If you have an iPhone, you might want to check out Procreate Pocket. It's a powerful drawing app that allows you to create detailed drawings using your finger or an Apple Pencil. It's not free, but it's relatively inexpensive compared to some other professional drawing apps.

4. Autodesk SketchBook: Another option is Autodesk SketchBook, which is available for both iOS and Android. It has many of the same features as SketchBook and supports layers, brushes, and a variety of drawing tools.

Overall, the best drawing app for you will depend on your personal preferences and the specific features you're looking for. You might want to try a few different apps to see which one works best for you.

Do any of these allow me to save a file that I could then import into inkscape on my desktop?

**assistant:**

Yes, all of the drawing apps I mentioned above allow you to save your artwork as a file that can be imported into Inkscape on your desktop computer. 

For example, in Adobe Illustrator Draw, you can save your file as an SVG file (which is a vector format that Inkscape supports) and then transfer the file to your computer using a cloud storage service or by emailing it to yourself. 

Similarly, in SketchBook, you can export your file as a PNG, JPG, or PSD file and then transfer it to your computer using a cloud storage service, email, or another transfer method.

In Procreate Pocket, you can export your file in a variety of formats, including PNG, JPEG, and PSD, and then transfer it to your computer using a cloud storage service or other transfer method.

In Autodesk SketchBook, you can also export your file in various formats, including PSD, JPG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF, and then transfer it to your computer as needed.

Just make sure to check the documentation for each app you use to see how to save or export your files in a format that is compatible with Inkscape.
