**user:**

I want to create content focused around my experience at a wasp accredited facility in Baja California where I spend three episodes setting up and all other episodes are tracking down people that are hiding

**assistant:**

Creating content based on your experience at a WASP accredited facility in Baja California sounds intriguing! It's essential to consider the narrative arc and character development throughout the episodes. For the setup episodes, you could focus on detailing the preparation process, the challenges faced, and the anticipation leading up to the pursuit. Then, for the tracking down episodes, each could feature a different individual or group hiding within the region, with each encounter revealing more about their motives, backgrounds, and connections to the facility. This structure can create suspense and keep viewers engaged as they follow along with the pursuit.
