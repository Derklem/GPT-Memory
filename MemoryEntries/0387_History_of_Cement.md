**user:**

Was there ever a point in recordable history post Roman empire where humanity or at least westernized humanity did not know how to make cement

**assistant:**

There is no definitive answer to this question as the historical record is not comprehensive enough to provide a clear picture of every civilization's technological advancements over time. However, it is generally believed that cement has been used by various civilizations throughout history.

The ancient Greeks and Romans, for example, used a form of cement made from lime and volcanic ash in their construction projects. This material, known as pozzolana, was also used by the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians.

During the Middle Ages in Europe, the use of cement declined as building techniques shifted toward stone and brick. However, lime mortar was still commonly used in construction, and the Romans' use of concrete continued to be appreciated.

The modern era of cement production began in the mid-19th century with the invention of Portland cement by Joseph Aspdin, an Englishman. This cement, made from limestone and clay, quickly became popular for its strength and durability.

So, while there may have been times and places where cement was not widely used or even unknown, it is likely that some form of cement has been used by various civilizations throughout recorded history.

**user:**

Then technically the answer would be Yes there was a large period of time which Western humans did not use cement in the same way that the Greeks and Romans did and instead supplemented lime mortar and available block or stone that was quarried

**assistant:**

Yes, that is correct. There was a period of time after the decline of the Roman Empire in Europe where the use of cement declined and building techniques shifted towards the use of stone and brick and the use of lime mortar became more common. During this time, cement was not used in the same way as it was during the Roman era, and it was supplanted by other building materials and techniques.

**user:**

Is there any way of identifying the last or most recent time cement had been used by the Romans?

**assistant:**

It is difficult to determine the exact point in time when the Romans stopped using cement in their construction projects, as the historical record is not precise enough to provide a definitive answer. However, it is generally believed that the use of cement declined in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, and the knowledge of how to make it was gradually lost or forgotten.

There are some examples of Roman concrete structures that still stand today, such as the Colosseum in Rome, which was built in the 1st century AD. It is believed that the concrete used in the Colosseum was made with a mixture of lime, volcanic ash, and water, known as pozzolana.

While it is difficult to determine the last or most recent time that cement was used by the Romans, it is known that the use of concrete declined in Europe during the Middle Ages, as builders began to rely more on stone and brick construction. The modern era of cement production did not begin until the mid-19th century, with the invention of Portland cement by Joseph Aspdin, an Englishman.

**user:**

Is there any historical indication as to where exactly the Romans obtained the knowledge to make form, finish and set cement

**assistant:**

The exact origins of Roman concrete and the knowledge of how to make it are not entirely clear, but there are several theories and historical indications about its development.

One theory is that the Romans learned how to make concrete from the Etruscans, an ancient civilization that preceded the Romans in Italy. The Etruscans were known for their advanced engineering techniques, and it is possible that the Romans learned the basics of cement-making from them.

Another theory is that the Romans developed their own cement-making techniques based on experimentation and trial and error. The Romans had access to a variety of materials, including lime, volcanic ash, and pozzolana, which they could combine in different ways to create concrete of varying strengths and properties.

It is also possible that the Romans learned about the properties of different materials through their conquests and interactions with other cultures. The use of concrete and cement-like materials has been found in ancient structures in places such as Greece, Egypt, and Persia, suggesting that the knowledge of how to make these materials was widespread in the ancient world.

Regardless of the exact origins of Roman concrete, it is clear that the Romans refined the process and used it extensively in their construction projects, including aqueducts, bridges, and monumental buildings.

**user:**

Did any older civilizations use cement? For instance the Egyptians or Babylonians or Assyrians? We're all of their structures carved from stones that were laid together with lime?

**assistant:**

Yes, there is evidence that some ancient civilizations used cement or cement-like materials in their construction projects.

The ancient Egyptians, for example, used a type of cement made from gypsum (a mineral composed of calcium sulfate) to plaster the walls of their buildings and tombs. They also used lime mortar to bind together the blocks of stone used in their structures, such as the pyramids and temples.

The Babylonians and Assyrians also used a type of cement made from bitumen, a naturally occurring tar-like substance, to seal their buildings and other structures against water infiltration. They also used clay and mud bricks in their construction projects, which were held together with mortar made from mud or clay.

It is worth noting that the exact techniques and materials used by ancient civilizations varied depending on the availability of local resources, the climate, and the purpose of the structure being built. While some civilizations may have used cement or cement-like materials, others relied more heavily on stone, brick, or other building materials.

**user:**

I'm actually more interested in the particulars of civilizations using cement as a poured substance to form blocks. I would like you to disregard any use of cement to bind existing blocks.

**assistant:**

It is unlikely that any ancient civilizations used cement as a poured substance to form blocks in the way that modern concrete is produced. The technology and resources necessary for producing large quantities of high-quality cement were not available in ancient times.

However, there are examples of ancient civilizations using a type of cement-like material to create molded shapes or objects. The ancient Greeks and Romans, for example, used a mixture of lime, volcanic ash, and water known as pozzolana to create molded objects such as statuary, amphorae, and tiles.

Similarly, the ancient Egyptians used a type of cement made from gypsum to create decorative objects and artifacts such as wall reliefs and statues.

While these examples show that ancient civilizations did use cement-like materials to create molded shapes or objects, there is no evidence that they used cement in the same way that modern concrete is used to create large, poured structures. The use of cement as a poured substance to form blocks is a relatively recent technological advancement, which only became feasible with the invention of hydraulic cement in the 19th century.

**user:**

So the Romans never poured cement?

**assistant:**

While the Romans did not pour cement in the same way that modern concrete is poured, they did use a type of cement-like material to create large, poured structures such as their famous aqueducts and harbor structures.

The Romans used a mixture of lime, volcanic ash, and water, known as pozzolana, to create their concrete. This mixture was poured into wooden molds, where it would harden and form a solid, durable structure.

The Romans also used this type of concrete to create monumental structures such as the dome of the Pantheon in Rome, which was poured in a single piece and remains one of the largest unsupported concrete domes in the world.

While the technology and resources available to the Romans were not the same as those available today, their use of poured concrete was a significant technological achievement and represents an important step in the development of modern concrete construction.

**user:**

When was the dome of the Pantheon made

**assistant:**

The dome of the Pantheon in Rome was built between AD 118 and AD 125, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. The Pantheon is one of the best-preserved ancient Roman buildings, and its dome is considered one of the greatest architectural achievements of the ancient world. The use of poured concrete in the construction of the dome allowed the Romans to create a structure of unprecedented size and complexity, and it remains a marvel of engineering to this day.

**user:**

It also reflects 1,000 years of masonry experience and craftsmanship.

**assistant:**

Yes, that's correct. While the use of poured concrete was a significant technological achievement, the dome of the Pantheon also reflects the Romans' extensive experience and expertise in masonry, engineering, and architecture. The construction of such a monumental structure required not only the use of advanced building materials and techniques but also the skill and knowledge of highly trained craftsmen and engineers. The dome is a testament to the ingenuity, creativity, and expertise of the ancient Romans, and it continues to inspire and awe visitors to this day.

**user:**

I find it misleading then when people stay to that we cannot create the same type of cement that Romans did because essentially, they're talking about a binding paste not a traditionally portable slab. Except when you talk about the dome of the Pantheon which apparently is not only one piece but has stood for over 2,000 years now

**assistant:**

You are correct that the term "cement" can be used to refer to a binding paste or a solid building material, and it is important to distinguish between the two. The ancient Romans did use a type of cement-like material to create both a binding paste and a solid building material, known as Roman concrete. Roman concrete was composed of a mixture of lime, volcanic ash, and aggregate, and it was poured into molds to create large, durable structures such as the dome of the Pantheon.

While it is true that modern concrete is not identical to Roman concrete, it is possible to create a similar material using modern technology and techniques. Researchers have studied ancient Roman concrete and have found that it has unique properties that make it more durable and long-lasting than modern concrete. By studying the composition of Roman concrete and replicating it using modern materials and techniques, it may be possible to create concrete that is stronger and more durable than traditional modern concrete.

So, while it is not accurate to say that we cannot create the same type of cement that the Romans did, it is true that their use of concrete was a remarkable technological achievement that reflected centuries of masonry experience and craftsmanship. The dome of the Pantheon, in particular, remains a testament to the skill and ingenuity of the ancient Romans, and it continues to inspire awe and admiration today.
