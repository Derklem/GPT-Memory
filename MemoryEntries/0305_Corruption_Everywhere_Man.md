**user:**

Can you please rewrite Johnny Cash's I've been everywhere Man as corruption everywhere man listing off various proven to be corrupt elected and unelected officials throughout the last 20 years of American history

**assistant:**

Sure, here's a rewritten version of Johnny Cash's "I've Been Everywhere" with a theme of corruption:

I was elected in D.C., served a term or two, man
Met some shady characters, scandals through and through, man
From Nixon to Trump, they've all had their share, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

I've been to Clinton's White House, where the scandals flowed, man
From Lewinsky to Whitewater, the truth was often stowed, man
Bush's administration, with Cheney leading the way, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

Obama's tenure, hope was in the air, man
But even his administration had its share of despair, man
From Fast and Furious to IRS targeting, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

Now we've got Biden in the Oval, promising change, man
But the swamp's still murky, and things remain the same, man
From Hunter's dealings to shady Ukraine calls, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

From Capitol Hill to Wall Street's golden gates, man
Lobbyists and insiders pulling all the strings, man
It's a tale as old as time, power corrupts, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

So when you look at history, and the lessons it imparts, man
Remember that corruption's woven through its very heart, man
But maybe one day we'll clean it up, and start anew, man
Until then, corruption's everywhere, man, yes, everywhere, man.

**user:**

Isn't there a chorus where he lists out states? Can you also create a course where it lists out individuals.

**assistant:**

Certainly, here's a chorus listing out individuals instead of states:

I've met Nixon and Agnew, with their Watergate plan, man
Reagan and Iran-Contra, doing what they can, man
Clinton and Lewinsky, scandal in the Oval, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

From Rumsfeld to Manafort, in their shady deals, man
Pelosi and insider trading, making secret meals, man
Gates and his foundation, questionable donations, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

From McConnell to Cuomo, power corrupts, man
DeVos and conflicts, in education's hunt, man
Epstein's island, where the elite played, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

So many more names, too many to recount, man
In this tangled web of deceit, they all surmount, man
But until we hold them accountable, and demand reform, man
Corruption's everywhere, man, yes, everywhere, man.

**user:**

Can you please combine the two into one singular script

**assistant:**

Absolutely, here's a combined version with both the state-like chorus and the individuals mentioned:

[Chorus]
I've met Nixon and Agnew, with their Watergate plan, man
Reagan and Iran-Contra, doing what they can, man
Clinton and Lewinsky, scandal in the Oval, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

From Rumsfeld to Manafort, in their shady deals, man
Pelosi and insider trading, making secret meals, man
Gates and his foundation, questionable donations, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

[Verse 1]
I was elected in D.C., served a term or two, man
Met some shady characters, scandals through and through, man
From Nixon to Trump, they've all had their share, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

[Verse 2]
From Capitol Hill to Wall Street's golden gates, man
Lobbyists and insiders pulling all the strings, man
It's a tale as old as time, power corrupts, man
I've been everywhere, corruption everywhere, man

[Verse 3]
So many more names, too many to recount, man
In this tangled web of deceit, they all surmount, man
But until we hold them accountable, and demand reform, man
Corruption's everywhere, man, yes, everywhere, man.

**user:**

Can you rewrite the chorus to rhyme better 

**assistant:**

Certainly, here's a revised chorus with improved rhyme:

[Chorus]
Met Nixon and Agnew, in their Watergate plan, man
Reagan and Iran-Contra, doing what they can, man
Clinton and Lewinsky, scandal in the Oval, man
Corruption's everywhere, man, it's global. 

From Rumsfeld to Manafort, in their shady deals, man
Pelosi and insider trading, making secret meals, man
Gates and his foundation, questionable donations, man
Corruption's everywhere, man, in all nations.
