Best career test for 38-year-old with a BA of art

**assistant:**

There are many career assessments and tests available that can help a 38-year-old with a BA in art identify potential career paths. Some popular options include:

1. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI): This test is based on Carl Jung's theory of personality types and can help individuals understand their strengths and preferences in order to find a career that aligns with them.

2. Strong Interest Inventory: This assessment measures an individual's interests and preferences and can help them identify careers that align with those interests.

3. The Holland Code: This assessment is based on John Holland's theory of career choice and helps individuals understand their personality type and how it relates to different types of careers.

4. The Campbell Interest and Skill Survey (CISS) : This assessment measures an individual's interests, skills, and values and can be used to identify potential careers that align with those areas.

It's important to note that while career assessments can be helpful, they are not the only factor to consider when choosing a career. It's also important to research potential careers, talk to people in those fields, and gain experience through internships or part-time jobs.
