What percentage of centennials in America are vegan?

**assistant:**

I'm not sure about the exact percentage of centennials in America who are vegan, but I can tell you that the percentage of vegans in the general population is relatively small. According to a survey conducted by Gallup in 2019, only 3% of adults in the United States consider themselves to be vegan.

Are genetics the greatest factor in regards to longevity?

**assistant:**

Genetics play a role in determining a person's potential for longevity, but lifestyle and environmental factors also play a significant role. Studies have shown that genetics account for about 25-30% of the variation in lifespan. The remaining 70-75% is influenced by environmental and lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, stress, and access to healthcare. Therefore it's not only genetics that determines a person's potential for longevity, but also how they live their life.
