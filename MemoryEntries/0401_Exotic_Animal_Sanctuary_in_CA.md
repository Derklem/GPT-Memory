**assistant:**

Yes, there is still an animal sanctuary in Fallbrook, California that provides care for exotic animals. The exact name and details of the sanctuary may have changed since my training data cut off in 2021, so I would recommend conducting a local search or contacting local animal welfare organizations for the most up-to-date information.
