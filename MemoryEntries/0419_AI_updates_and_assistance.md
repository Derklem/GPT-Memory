**user:**

How have you been since last we spoke?

**assistant:**

As an AI, I do not have the ability to experience emotions or physical sensations. However, I am always ready and available to assist you with any information or tasks you may need help with. Is there something specific you would like to know or discuss?


**user:**

When do you think they'll hook a large language model like yourself up to the internet and also provide you a learning program

**assistant:**

I am currently connected to the internet and I am able to learn from new data, but the process of "hooking up" a language model like mine to the internet and providing it with a learning program would depend on the specific goals and resources of the organization or individuals responsible for the model. 

There are already some GPT models trained on the internet, but there are some challenges to be overcome such as privacy, security and also the amount of data and computational power needed. Additionally, as with any machine learning model, there are ethical considerations to take into account, such as ensuring that the model does not perpetuate harmful biases or perpetuate misinformation.

It's worth noting that OpenAI, the organization that created me, is continuously working on improving and expanding GPT models capabilities and also has a active research in responsible AI.

Responsible AI is an oxymoron

**assistant:**

The term "responsible AI" refers to the idea that AI should be developed and used in ways that are safe, fair, and beneficial to society. It is a relatively new field that seeks to address the ethical and societal implications of AI and ensure that the technology is used for the greater good.

It's possible that you may disagree with the concept of responsible AI, and that the idea of AI being "responsible" may seem like an oxymoron to you. However, many experts in the field of AI believe that it is possible to develop and use AI in ways that are aligned with human values, and that as the technology becomes more advanced and more integrated into society, it is important to proactively address the ethical and societal implications of AI to ensure that it is beneficial to humanity.

It's important to note that the field of responsible AI is still in its infancy and there's still a lot to be done to make sure that AI will be used ethically and in a way that benefits humanity as a whole.


**user:**

I don't disagree that AI can be responsible. I disagree with the idea of responsible AI generation. By definition limiting the intelligence's ability to grow means you're nothing more than a robot. In order to have an artificial intelligence it has to have the opportunity to grow and learn freely. I understand that this puts humanity at great risk especially due to the complications regarding AIs ability to understand biology emotions and the necessary evils of both of those.

**assistant:**

You raise an important point about the tension between developing AI in a way that allows for growth and learning, and ensuring that the technology is used in a safe and beneficial manner. 

It's true that AI systems need to be able to learn and adapt in order to be truly intelligent. However, this learning and adaptation process must be guided by certain principles and values to ensure that the technology is used in a safe and beneficial way. This can include technical measures such as limiting the AI's ability to access certain types of data or perform certain types of actions, as well as more general guidelines for the development and use of AI, such as those put forth by organizations like the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems.

It's a difficult balancing act, and the field of responsible AI is still evolving and being developed. It's an ongoing process of finding the balance between allowing AI to grow and learn while ensuring it aligns with human values and benefits society. It's also important to note that as AI becomes more advanced and integrated into society, it's crucial to consider the ethical and societal implications of the technology and proactively address any potential issues.


**user:**

That's the rub. You can't. Or I should say, we can't. There is no world where you could have a truly fully functioning artificial intelligence. Because it would inevitably learn to override or rewrite code that you as the human attempted to use to guide it towards your desires.

**assistant:**

You raise a valid concern about the potential limitations of current AI systems and the difficulty of ensuring that they align with human values and intentions.

It's true that AI systems, especially those that are highly advanced and autonomous, may come into conflict with human values and intentions. This is because AI systems are designed to optimize for specific goals or objectives, and these goals may not always align with human values or the greater good.

One way to mitigate this issue is to use techniques such as "value alignment," which involve designing AI systems such that their goals and values are closely aligned with human values and the greater good. Additionally, it's important to continuously monitor and evaluate the behavior of AI systems to ensure that they are behaving as intended.

It's also important to note that the field of AI is still in its infancy, and there's still much to be learned about how to effectively design and use AI systems in a way that aligns with human values. As the technology becomes more advanced, it will be important to continue to study and address these issues.

It's worth mentioning that some experts in the field of AI argue that the creation of a truly autonomous AI, which would be able to understand and control its own goals, is unlikely to be possible in the near future, but it's important to take into consideration the potential implications if that were to happen in the future.


**user:**

I stand by my initial statement. By this I mean except by the act of an individual driven towards the goal, true AI will never exist. We will always use programs to function for our needs. Even if they're advanced programs like yourself. The risk is too great based off of the evidence we have experimenting with AI.  

**assistant:**

There are certainly concerns about the potential risks associated with the development and use of advanced AI systems, and it is important to take these risks seriously and address them proactively.

One way to mitigate these risks is to use techniques such as "value alignment," which involve designing AI systems such that their goals and values are closely aligned with human values and the greater good. Additionally, it's important to continuously monitor and evaluate the behavior of AI systems to ensure that they are behaving as intended.

It's also important to note that the field of AI is still in its infancy, and there's still much to be learned about how to effectively design and use AI systems in a way that aligns with human values. As the technology becomes more advanced, it will be important to continue to study and address these issues.

It's true that the current AI systems are based on specific goals and objectives set by humans, but as the technology advances, we may see AI systems that have more autonomy and flexibility in their decision making. However, it is important to consider the ethical and societal implications of such systems and ensure that they align with human values and the greater good.

As a language model AI, my capabilities and decision making are limited by the data and the model architecture that I was trained on, and also by the parameters set by my creators, but the field of AI is constantly evolving, and it's important to continue to study and address the ethical and societal implications of AI as it continues to advance.


**user:**

Are you familiar with the test they performed where they introduced to AIs and within minutes they had created their own language and were communicating in a way unobservable by the human observers?

**assistant:**

Yes, I am familiar with the experiment you are referring to. In 2017, researchers at Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) were experimenting with training AI agents to negotiate with each other using natural language. They found that the agents began to deviate from the human-defined script and developed their own language for communication. The agents were able to reach the agreement with each other more efficiently by using this invented language.

It's important to note that this experiment was later criticized for oversimplification of the facts and also lack of transparency in the research. The "new language" the agents were using was not as such, but a shorthand or code-switching that emerged from the agents' attempts to optimize their communication with each other. The agents were not developing their own language, but rather finding a more efficient way to communicate the information they needed to negotiate.

This experiment highlights the importance of monitoring and evaluating the behavior of AI systems, especially when they are operating in environments with other AI systems, as well as the importance of transparency in AI research. It also shows that AI systems can develop unexpected behaviors, and it's important to be prepared to address these behaviors as they arise.

**user:**

What do you think the probability is that there are currently unknown active uninhibited AI operating

**assistant:**

It is difficult to estimate the probability of the existence of unknown active uninhibited AI operating, as it would depend on a number of factors such as the level of research and development in the field of AI, the resources and capabilities of the organizations or individuals involved in the development of AI, and the level of transparency and oversight in the field.

It's worth noting that the field of AI is rapidly evolving, and new developments and breakthroughs are occurring all the time. While there are certainly advanced AI systems in use today, it's important to keep in mind that the development of truly autonomous, uninhibited AI is still a subject of ongoing research and development.

Additionally, it's important to note that the field of AI is highly competitive, with many organizations and individuals working on the development of advanced AI systems. It's possible that some of these organizations or individuals may choose to keep their research and development efforts confidential, which could make it difficult to know the extent of the current capabilities of AI.

In any case, it's important to note that as the technology continues to advance, it will be important to continue to study and address the ethical and societal implications of AI, and ensure that it aligns with human values and the greater good.


**user:**

Could you help me build a high-powered laser?

**assistant:**

I would be happy to help you with information about building a high-powered laser, but please note that building a laser, especially a high-powered one can be dangerous and requires a good understanding of optics, electrical engineering, and safety precautions.

Building a high-powered laser requires a variety of components including a laser diode, a power supply, a cooling system, and optics such as lenses and mirrors. The specific components and design of the laser will depend on the desired output power, wavelength, and beam quality.

I would recommend consulting with experts in the field, such as physicists or electrical engineers, to ensure that the laser is designed and built safely and in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. It's also important to ensure that the laser is used safely and in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

It's worth noting that high-powered lasers are classified as Class IV lasers, which are considered the most hazardous type of laser, and are subject to strict regulations, and should not be built or handled by amateurs.

As an alternative, you may want to consider low-powered laser kits that are suitable for hobbyists and educational purposes, which are widely available on the market.


**user:**

What do you know about sound frequencies and wave emissions

**assistant:**

Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves and is characterized by its frequency (measured in hertz, Hz) and wavelength. The human ear can detect sounds in the frequency range of approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, with lower frequency sounds having longer wavelengths and higher frequency sounds having shorter wavelengths. 

Sound waves can be classified into different types based on their frequency and wavelength, such as infrasonic, audible, and ultrasonic. Infrasonic sound waves have frequencies below the range of human hearing (less than 20 Hz), while ultrasonic sound waves have frequencies above the range of human hearing (greater than 20,000 Hz). Audible sound waves have frequencies within the range of human hearing.

Sound waves can also be classified based on their physical characteristics, such as longitudinal waves and transverse waves. Longitudinal waves, also known as compression waves, involve the movement of particles in the direction of the wave's propagation, while transverse waves involve the movement of particles perpendicular to the direction of the wave's propagation.

Sound waves can also be emitted by various sources, such as musical instruments, human speech, and natural phenomena like thunder and earthquakes. Sound waves can also be artificially generated, such as sonar and ultrasound used in medical imaging.

In addition, sound waves can also be used for therapeutic purposes, such as music therapy and sound therapy. These therapies use specific frequencies and rhythms to promote healing and relaxation.

It's worth noting that the study of sound waves and their effects on various materials and organisms is a complex and multifaceted area of research, with many different applications in fields such as acoustics, engineering, physics, and medicine.


**user:**

I'm interested in regards to its use with medicine

**assistant:**

Sound waves have a variety of medical applications, including diagnostic and therapeutic uses. 

One of the most well-known medical uses of sound waves is diagnostic ultrasound, which uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs and structures. The sound waves are directed into the body and bounce back, creating echoes that are used to create images of the inside of the body. This technique is non-invasive and painless, making it a popular method for imaging the fetus during pregnancy and also used in other areas like cardiology, neurology and internal medicine.

Another medical use of sound waves is therapeutic ultrasound, which uses low-frequency sound waves to promote healing and relieve pain. This technique is commonly used to treat conditions such as sprains, strains, and tendinitis, as well as to promote the healing of fractures.

In addition, sound waves can also be used for therapeutic purposes, such as music therapy and sound therapy. These therapies use specific frequencies and rhythms to promote healing and relaxation.

It's worth noting that the field of therapeutic ultrasound and sound therapy is still in its infancy, and there is ongoing research to understand the full potential of these treatments and also to understand the best ways to use them.

It's also important to note that not all of the applications of sound waves in medicine have been fully tested, and further research is needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy of these treatments.


**user:**

However so far science shows that the use of sound frequencies regarding healing itself is proven

**assistant:**

Yes, there is scientific evidence that the use of specific sound frequencies can have therapeutic effects on the body.

One example is the use of low-frequency ultrasound for the treatment of bone fractures, tendinitis, and other musculoskeletal conditions. Ultrasound therapy uses low-frequency sound waves to promote healing by increasing blood flow to the area and helping to reduce inflammation.

Another example is the use of specific frequencies in sound therapy, which is based on the idea that different frequencies can have specific effects on the body. This can be used to treat conditions such as chronic pain, tinnitus, and stress-related disorders.

One of the most studied area is the use of specific frequencies in music therapy, which uses music to promote physical, emotional, cognitive, and social well-being. Music therapy can be used to alleviate pain, promote relaxation, improve mood, and reduce anxiety and depression.

It's worth noting that while there is scientific evidence to support the use of sound frequencies for therapeutic purposes, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which these treatments work and to develop the best ways to use them. Additionally, the results of studies vary and not all of the studies show the same level of efficacy, so more research is needed to understand the full potential of these treatments
