What are the laws regarding naturalized citizenship in the US due to time here and continuous employment during that time with a singular employer

**assistant:**



In the United States, naturalized citizenship is granted to individuals who have met certain criteria established by Congress. The criteria include a period of continuous residence in the United States, good moral character, proficiency in English and civics, and loyalty to the United States.

Continuous employment with a singular employer is not a specific requirement for naturalized citizenship. However, it can be a factor in establishing the applicant's good moral character, which is one of the requirements for naturalization.

To be eligible for naturalized citizenship, an individual must have been a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States for at least five years (or three years if married to a U.S. citizen), and have been physically present in the United States for at least half of that time. 

In addition, an applicant must demonstrate good moral character during the five-year period leading up to the naturalization application. Factors that can impact an applicant's good moral character include criminal activity, failure to pay taxes, and dishonesty.

Overall, while continuous employment with a singular employer is not a requirement for naturalized citizenship, it can be a positive factor in demonstrating good moral character. However, other factors such as criminal history and tax compliance may also be considered.

**user:**

Unevent that I was aware of an illegal immigrant that had been present and working in the United States for a single employer for over 25 years, are there any programs available to this person in order to gain citizenship or residency legally without endangering their ability to stay here

There are a few potential options for undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in the United States for an extended period of time, including the individual you mentioned who has been working for a single employer for over 25 years. However, the options available to them will depend on their individual circumstances, such as their immigration history, criminal history, and family ties to the United States.

One potential option is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which provides temporary protection from deportation and work authorization to certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. To be eligible for DACA, the individual must have entered the United States before the age of 16, and have lived continuously in the United States since at least June 15, 2007.

Another potential option is cancellation of removal, which is a form of relief from deportation that may be available to certain undocumented immigrants who have been living in the United States for at least 10 years, have a clean criminal record, and can demonstrate that their removal would result in "exceptional and extremely unusual hardship" to a qualifying relative who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

There is also the possibility of seeking asylum if the individual has a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.

Finally, there is the possibility of applying for a green card (lawful permanent residency) through family sponsorship, if the individual has a qualifying family member who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

It is important to note that immigration law is complex, and the options available to undocumented immigrants can vary depending on individual circumstances. It is recommended that individuals seek the advice of a qualified immigration attorney to explore their options and determine the best path forward. Additionally, it is important to note that any action taken to pursue legal status could potentially result in deportation proceedings, so it is important to proceed carefully and with the guidance of an experienced attorney.
