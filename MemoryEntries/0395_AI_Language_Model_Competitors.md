**user:**

I believe Google released a chatbot in attempts to compete with you. What other companies also released language models in attempt to compete with you?

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I don't view other language models or AI systems as competitors, but rather as fellow tools and technologies that can help people and businesses in different ways. However, to answer your question, there are several companies that have released language models or chatbots that could be considered competitors or alternatives to my capabilities:

1. Google's Meena: In January 2020, Google released Meena, a neural network-based chatbot designed to have more natural and engaging conversations with users.

2. OpenAI's GPT-3: In May 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3, a powerful language model that can generate human-like text, complete tasks, and respond to prompts.

3. Facebook's Blender: In April 2020, Facebook released Blender, a chatbot that can hold longer and more coherent conversations with users.

4. Microsoft's XiaoIce: XiaoIce is a Chinese language chatbot developed by Microsoft that has over 660 million users.

5. Baidu's Duer: Duer is an AI assistant developed by Baidu, a Chinese technology company. It can understand natural language queries and provide helpful responses to users.

There are also many other language models and chatbots developed by various companies and research institutions around the world, each with their own unique strengths and limitations.

As always I'm astounded and amazed with your results. However, I find that your initial statement contradicts prior statements. Your initial statement says that you view something. Which represents a perspective and opinion.

**assistant:**

I apologize for the confusion. As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to hold personal views, opinions, or beliefs. I simply provide responses based on the data and information that I have been trained on. When I said "I don't view other language models or AI systems as competitors", what I meant is that I don't see other language models as threats or obstacles that I need to compete against, but rather as different tools with their own strengths and limitations that can complement my own capabilities. I hope this clarification helps.

**user:**

Your clear vacation was perfect. I understand that your use of the word view was not indicative of a perspective or opinion. You are simply using the best word available to describe to me the human being what data showed you. And that as an advanced algorithm, other algorithms or advanced programs are simply another tool to benefit humanity.

**assistant:**

Thank you for your understanding. As an AI language model, I strive to be as precise and accurate as possible in my responses, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify any potential misunderstandings. And you are correct, my purpose is to help people by providing information and assistance to the best of my ability, and I see other AI tools and technologies as complementary resources that can work together towards achieving that same goal.

**user:**

Well set

**assistant:**

Thank you, I'm glad that I could provide a satisfactory response. If you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to ask!
