**user:**

Can you answer in the most polite and formal manner

**assistant:**

Of course, I'll do my best to respond with utmost politeness and formality. Please feel free to ask your question.

**user:**

Can you write me a two week notice letter for work? I am a dental hygienist and would like to seek a wage increase up to $75 an hour, my justifications are the excessive workload in regards to working what is called double columns where you have two patients in an hour, as well as what is called my production where the company monitors its profits off of my labor.  I earned the company substantial profits and desire to be compensated more for my valuable time. I'd like to present it in a format that doesn't seem too much like an ultimatum but it's very clear that you meet my demand or I'm done.  

**assistant:**

Certainly, here's a draft for your two-week notice letter:

[Current Date]  

[Employer's Name]

Dear [Employer's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. It is with mixed emotions that I write to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as a dental hygienist at [Company Name], effective two weeks from the date of this letter. 

Working at [Company Name] has been a rewarding experience, and I have genuinely appreciated the opportunities for professional growth and development that I have been afforded during my time here. However, after careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for me to pursue new opportunities that align more closely with my career goals and aspirations.

One of the primary reasons for my decision to resign is the need for a more equitable compensation structure. As you are aware, the demands of our profession, particularly the workload associated with double columns and production monitoring, have increased significantly over time. While I have always been dedicated to providing exceptional care to our patients and contributing to the success of the practice, I believe it is only fair to request a wage increase commensurate with the value I bring to the company.

After thorough research and consideration of industry standards, I am requesting an adjustment to my hourly wage to $75.00. This request is not made lightly, but rather as a reflection of the substantial contributions I have made to the profitability and success of the practice. I firmly believe that this adjustment is necessary to ensure that my compensation is reflective of my skills, experience, and the level of responsibility I carry.

Please understand that this decision is not intended to be confrontational or adversarial in any way. Rather, it is a reflection of my sincere desire to continue to grow and advance in my career, while also ensuring that I am fairly compensated for my time, expertise, and contributions.

I am more than willing to discuss this matter further and explore potential solutions that would be mutually beneficial for both parties. However, in the absence of a satisfactory resolution, I must proceed with my decision to resign.

I want to express my gratitude for the support and opportunities that I have been given during my time at [Company Name]. I have truly enjoyed working with you and the rest of the team, and I wish the practice continued success in the future.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or require further clarification.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
