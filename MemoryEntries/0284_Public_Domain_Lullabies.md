**user:**

can you list a specific recording for each that is in the public domain, with a url?

**user:**

None of those videos are available anymore.

**assistant:**

I'm sorry to hear that the links are unavailable. Finding specific recordings of public domain lullabies can be tricky due to the variety of recordings available online and their varying copyright statuses. However, you can often find recordings of these lullabies in the public domain by searching for them on platforms like YouTube or websites that specialize in public domain music. Alternatively, you might find recordings on websites that offer royalty-free or public domain music for download.

**user:**

Can you provide alternatives

**assistant:**

Certainly! Here are alternative ways to find public domain recordings of lullabies:

1. **YouTube**: While some specific recordings may not be available due to copyright restrictions, you can search for general terms like "public domain lullabies" or "royalty-free lullabies" on YouTube. Many creators upload compilations or recordings of public domain lullabies that you can listen to or use for your purposes.

2. **Public Domain Music Websites**: Websites like Musopen or Free Music Archive offer collections of public domain music, including lullabies. You can search their databases for specific lullabies and download the recordings directly from their platforms.

3. **Library of Congress**: The Library of Congress website offers access to historical recordings that are in the public domain. While the selection may be limited, you might find some recordings of lullabies from earlier eras that are no longer under copyright.

4. **Royalty-Free Music Libraries**: There are numerous royalty-free music libraries online where you can search for lullabies. While not all recordings may be in the public domain, many libraries offer a selection of royalty-free music that can be used for various purposes without attribution or royalties.

5. **Creative Commons Search**: You can use the Creative Commons search tool to find music that is available for use under various Creative Commons licenses, including public domain. You can filter your search specifically for public domain content and look for recordings of lullabies.

By exploring these alternatives, you should be able to find recordings of lullabies that are in the public domain or available for royalty-free use.
