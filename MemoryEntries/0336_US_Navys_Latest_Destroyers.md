# US Navy's Latest Destroyers

_Created: 2023-04-26T02:25:47+00:00_

**user:**

What was the latest class of destroyers the United States Navy added to its fleet

**assistant:**

As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, the latest class of destroyers added to the United States Navy fleet is the Zumwalt class. The Zumwalt class of destroyers is a new class of guided-missile destroyers designed and built by the United States Navy. The first ship of the class, the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), was commissioned in 2016, and the second ship, the USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001), was commissioned in 2019. These destroyers are notable for their advanced technology, including their stealth capabilities and their Integrated Power System, which allows them to generate electricity to power weapons and other systems.

**user:**

I believe it's this class of ship that faced extraordinary issues performing in all forms of performance

**assistant:**

Yes, you are correct. The Zumwalt class of destroyers faced a number of issues and challenges during their development and initial deployment. One of the most significant issues was with their advanced weapons system, the Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP), which was ultimately canceled due to cost overruns. In addition, the ships also faced problems with their radar systems, their power generation and distribution systems, and their software. These issues resulted in delays, cost overruns, and a reduced number of ships being built. The Zumwalt class of destroyers is considered to be one of the most expensive and controversial shipbuilding programs in U.S. Navy history.

**user:**

Wasn't there also an issue regarding the solidity of the whole and the armor plating? Also, who was the contractor that built the zumwalt class destroyer and has there been any legal action against them by the United States government in order to recoup the billions of dollars of investment that went into the development of those craft before they were then purchased by the government.

**assistant:**

Yes, you are correct. In addition to the issues I mentioned earlier, there were also concerns about the hull and armor plating of the Zumwalt class destroyers. Specifically, the ships' hulls were found to be less durable than expected during testing, and the Navy determined that the armor plating would need to be upgraded to better protect the ship and its crew.

The Zumwalt class destroyers were built by General Dynamics Bath Iron Works in Maine, USA. To my knowledge, there has not been any legal action taken by the US government against the contractor to recoup the billions of dollars of investment that went into the development of the ships. However, the US government has withheld payments to the contractor due to issues with the ships' performance and delays in their delivery. The contractor has also been required to pay some of the costs associated with fixing the ships' issues.

**user:**

How much money has actually been paid how much money is owed as a remainder on the contract

**assistant:**

To my knowledge, the exact amounts of money paid and owed on the Zumwalt class destroyer contract are not publicly available. However, it is known that the program experienced significant cost overruns, and the total cost of the three Zumwalt class destroyers that were built is estimated to be around $22 billion. The Navy reportedly withheld over $1 billion in payments to the contractor due to issues with the ships' performance and delays in their delivery.

It's worth noting that the Zumwalt class destroyer program was restructured in 2017, and the Navy announced that it would only build three ships, rather than the originally planned 32 ships. The remaining funds that had been allocated to the program were redirected to other Navy initiatives.

**user:**

How much money to date has been paid and how many ships are there of the zumwalt class

**assistant:**

As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, the United States Navy has commissioned three Zumwalt class destroyers, which have been built by General Dynamics Bath Iron Works in Maine. The three ships are:

1. USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) - commissioned in 2016
2. USS Michael Monsoor (DDG-1001) - commissioned in 2019
3. USS Lyndon B. Johnson (DDG-1002) - commissioned in 2021

The total cost of the Zumwalt program, including research and development, is estimated to be around $22 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The exact amount paid to date and the amount owed on the contract are not publicly available, but as I mentioned earlier, the Navy has reportedly withheld over $1 billion in payments to the contractor due to issues with the ships' performance and delays in their delivery.

**user:**

1 billion against the 21 billion that has already been collected by the contractor is not a victory. Who would be the person to contact in order to instigate an investigation and prosecution in order to overcome this very corrupt function of the American government regarding its lobbyist and contractors

**assistant:**

If you have concerns about potential corruption or wrongdoing related to the Zumwalt class destroyer program or other defense contracting, I would recommend contacting the appropriate government agencies and officials. 

The Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for investigating fraud, waste, and abuse in DoD programs and operations. They have the authority to investigate allegations of misconduct by defense contractors and government employees. 

You may also want to contact your representatives in Congress or the Senate to express your concerns and request that they investigate the matter. Members of Congress have the authority to conduct oversight of federal agencies and programs, and can request information from government agencies and hold hearings on the matter. 

Additionally, you can report allegations of fraud or corruption related to government contracts to the DoD Hotline or the Department of Justice. These agencies investigate allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse related to government programs and contracts.

**user:**

How would I contact the office inspector general for the DOD? Also if I live in Oceanside California which congressman am I contacting? 

**assistant:**

You can contact the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Defense (DoD IG) by phone, email, or mail. Their contact information is as follows:

Phone: 800-424-9098 (toll-free)
Email: hotline@dodig.mil
Mail: Department of Defense Office of Inspector General
DoD Hotline
4800 Mark Center Drive
Alexandria, VA 22350-1500

As for contacting your representative in Congress, Oceanside is located in California's 49th congressional district. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the representative for that district was Mike Levin. You can contact his office through his website, email, phone, or mail. His contact information is as follows:

Website: https://mikelevin.house.gov/

**user:**

Were there any other recent military contracts that ended in a similar fashion?

**assistant:**

There have been several recent military contracts that have experienced cost overruns, delays, or performance issues. Here are a few examples:

1. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: The F-35 program is one of the largest and most expensive military procurement programs in history. It has experienced numerous delays and cost overruns, and the total cost of the program is estimated to be over $1.7 trillion over its lifetime. The F-35 has also faced performance issues, with some critics questioning its effectiveness compared to other aircraft.

2. Littoral Combat Ship (LCS): The LCS is a class of small, fast warships designed for operations in shallow waters. The program has experienced significant cost overruns and delays, and the ships have faced criticism for their survivability and lack of firepower.

3. Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV): The EFV was a Marine Corps amphibious assault vehicle designed to transport troops from ship to shore. The program was cancelled in 2011 after experiencing significant cost overruns and performance issues.

4. Future Combat Systems (FCS): The FCS was a major Army modernization program that aimed to develop a new generation of combat vehicles, weapons, and sensors. The program was cancelled in 2009 after experiencing significant cost overruns and technical problems.

These are just a few examples, but there have been other military programs that have faced similar issues. The Department of Defense has implemented reforms to try to address these problems, but procurement and acquisition remain complex and challenging processes.

**user:**

What were the budgets for each one of those and which contractor was responsible for the contract

**assistant:**

Here is some information on the budgets and contractors for the military programs I mentioned earlier:

1. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: The F-35 program is being developed by Lockheed Martin. The total estimated cost of the program is over $1.7 trillion over its lifetime, including development, procurement, and operating costs.

2. Littoral Combat Ship (LCS): The LCS program has been developed by two contractors, Lockheed Martin and Austal USA. The program has experienced significant cost overruns, with the estimated cost of the program increasing from $220 million per ship to over $450 million per ship.

3. Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV): The EFV program was being developed by General Dynamics. The program was cancelled in 2011 after experiencing significant cost overruns, with the estimated cost of the program increasing from $13.2 billion to over $23 billion.

4. Future Combat Systems (FCS): The FCS program was being developed by a team of contractors led by Boeing and SAIC. The program was cancelled in 2009 after experiencing significant cost overruns and technical problems. The estimated cost of the program was over $200 billion.

It is important to note that these are estimates, and the actual cost of these programs may differ from these figures. Additionally, some of these programs have been restructured or cancelled due to their cost and performance issues.

**user:**

Your list and it's estimations are perfect and I understand that I would need to do further research in order to have accurate tangible data. Can you give me five more projects and/or contractors from the last 10 years that failed to provide under a military contract?

**assistant:**

Sure, here are five more recent examples of military programs that have faced challenges:

1. KC-46 Pegasus: The KC-46 is a new aerial refueling tanker being developed by Boeing for the Air Force. The program has experienced significant delays and cost overruns, with the estimated cost of the program increasing from $4.9 billion to over $9.6 billion.

2. Zumwalt-class Destroyer: The Zumwalt-class destroyer, developed by General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, faced significant cost overruns and technical issues. The program was reduced from 32 ships to just three, with the total cost of the program estimated at over $22 billion.

3. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV): The JLTV is a new light vehicle being developed for the Army and Marine Corps. The program has faced delays and cost overruns, with the total cost of the program estimated at over $19 billion.

4. V-22 Osprey: The V-22 Osprey, developed by Boeing and Bell Helicopter, is a tiltrotor aircraft used by the Marine Corps and Air Force. The program faced technical issues and cost overruns during development, with the total cost of the program estimated at over $72 billion.

5. Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) System: The GMD system, developed by Boeing, is designed to intercept ballistic missiles in mid-flight. The program has faced technical issues and cost overruns, with the estimated cost of the program increasing from $40 billion to over $60 billion.

Again, it's important to note that these are estimates and the actual costs and outcomes of these programs may differ.
