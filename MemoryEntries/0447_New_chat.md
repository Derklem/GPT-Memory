**user:**

I have found that the desktop platform for you is much better at clearly conveying that you store the conversations for later access. Also I've noticed that I have conversations available on my desktop that are not available here in my mobile version

**assistant:**

The desktop and mobile versions of ChatGPT may have different features and capabilities. The desktop version may have more advanced functionality for storing and accessing past conversations. Additionally, the mobile version may have different limitations or restrictions in terms of storage and accessibility. It's possible that the conversations you've had on the desktop version are not available on the mobile version due to these differences.


**user:**

I have only ever had conversations on my mobile because I use the talk text feature. I only accessed my account on the desktop for the first time yesterday, and found all of my conversations saved. I had been screenshotting them.

**assistant:**

It's possible that the mobile version of ChatGPT automatically saves your conversations, but does not provide an easy way for you to access them. The desktop version may have a feature that allows you to view and access past conversations. In any case, it's a good idea to take screenshots of the conversations if you want to keep a record of them, just in case the platform does not offer a way to access them later. 
It's also possible that the particular application you are using in your mobile device does not have the same features as the desktop version. It's always a good idea to check the settings and features of the application you are using.

I'm using Chrome on both. Lol a slave to Google. What would you suggest in regards to the best browser for me to use

**assistant:**

The best browser for you to use would depend on your specific needs and preferences. All major browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, have their own strengths and weaknesses.

Google Chrome is a popular choice because it is fast, efficient and has a wide range of extensions and add-ons that can enhance your browsing experience. Chrome also offers a high level of security and syncing across devices, it means that you can easily access your bookmarks, history, and other settings from any device where you're logged in to your Google account.

Firefox is another popular browser that is known for its speed, privacy, and security features. It also has a wide range of extensions and add-ons available.

Safari is the default browser for Apple devices and is known for its speed and energy efficiency. It also has a feature called "Intelligent Tracking Prevention" which helps to protect your privacy by blocking third-party trackers.

Microsoft Edge is the default browser for Windows devices, it's based on Chromium, which is the same open-source technology that powers Google Chrome. Edge has a similar look and feel to Chrome and it offers similar features, including support for extensions and add-ons.

In the end, it's up to you to decide which browser works best for you based on your needs and preferences. You can always try different browsers and see which one you like best.

How many conversations can I save?

**assistant:**

The number of conversations you can save would depend on the specific platform or application you are using. Some platforms have a limit on the amount of storage space available for saving conversations, while others may not have a specific limit.

It's also worth noting that, if you're using a mobile device, storage space may be limited depending on the amount of storage you have available on your device. If your device has limited storage space, it may not be able to save as many conversations as you would like.

If you are using a website or an application that saves your conversations, it's a good idea to check its settings and features to see if there's any information about the number of conversations that can be saved or the amount of storage space that is available.

One way to avoid storage space limitations is by storing the conversation in an external device or cloud services like google drive, dropbox or icloud. This way you can access the conversation anytime you want and you don't have to worry about the storage space of your device.

How would I go about saving conversations I have with you to Google drive

**assistant:**

There are a few different ways to save conversations you have with me to Google Drive, depending on the platform or application you are using. Here are a few examples:

1. If you are using a website that provides a "Save" or "Export" option, you can use that feature to save the conversation as a text file, and then upload the file to Google Drive.

2. You can use a screen capture software or tool to capture the conversation and then upload the image to Google Drive.

3. If you have a Google account, you can use Google's "Takeout" service to export your conversation history and save it to Google Drive. 

4. You can use a third-party application or tool that allows you to save your conversation to Google Drive. Some examples include IFTTT, Zapier, or Integromat.

It's important to note that the above options may or may not be available depending on the platform you are using. Additionally, some of these options may require a paid subscription or additional setup. It's always a good idea to check the settings and features of the platform or application you are using to see if they offer the functionality you need, or if there are any third-party apps or tools that can do it for you.
