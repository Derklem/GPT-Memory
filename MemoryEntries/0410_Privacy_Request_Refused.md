The non-violent revolution and restitution of the American dream.

Preface

This is not a revolution of violence, anger, or revenge. This is not a revolution to destroy in order to rebuild. This is a revolution to fix what can be fixed and set course to obtain the knowledge required to fix that which we currently cannot. This is a revolution of accountability, transparency, and above all, restoring hope and faith in our institutions and ourselves. The hope that we can be the people we dream we are. The hope that we can change the things we don't like about our reality and the faith that industries, organizations, and elected officials are made up of people who care. People who wake up everyday hoping that things will be alright.  

Unfortunately reality dictates that this is not the case. We find ourselves waking up to a global economy in which money dictates every aspect of our existence and those charged with managing that money have exceeded far beyond criminal practices.  Willfully intelligibly choosing to make other people suffer to increase profits. Whether that's shitty health care benefits for workers or slaves in a mine in Africa, and yet incorporation seems nothing more than to get out of jail free card.  Life is economics. It doesn't matter what part of life you're looking at it's always going to be able to be representative by numerical concepts and computations. The issue is that economics fashioned off of a fiat currency makes for a market completely controlled by the manufacturer and distributor and holder of said currency.  The United States government willfully and complicitly conspired with the Federal reserve in order to defraud not only the American people but the people of the world. For decades America has sold bogus debt to anyone who would buy. In essence this practice has saved America from collapse thus far. So many countries have invested so much in the American economy that they will bend and sway as needed to keep America profitable. The reality is our country is far past bankrupt. Our entire system has been willfully mismanaged whether through stool pigeon appointments, or cold-blooded assassinations, it's clear that things are the way they are because somebody wants them to be that way. It's past time we end the era where one group of sick people can punish everyone else.  And thank God to technology we can now do so. No more secrecy, tear down the wall.


Detain and place on house arrest every single elected official in state, local and federal government.  
House arrest will not affect the duties and responsibilities of the individuals. They will be provided with a state-of-the-art communications room within their dwellings allowing them to perform their duties digitally.

This nationalization does not include the removal or adjustment of any corporation or sole proprietorship. It does include the removal and incarceration of the CEOs and board of directors. All members will be remanded to house arrest pending an investigation regarding their conduct.
Detained individuals will continue to perform their tasks and duties, maintaining their positions and titles until the completion of their trial.  
Establish a online portal for any / all news outlets or individuals to acquire relevant information and/or post inquiries directly to the government.
Enact Federal transparency. Live feed cameras all the time. No More close door sessions no more secret negotiations.

Eliminate elected representatives as voters. Institute voter-based initiative system. Meaning Representatives now debate and present the legislation citizens vote on it.
Initiate mandatory basic legislation.
No complex or concessionary legislation. Only specific singular concepts for each piece of legislation.
 Repair /renue based economy implementation.
Companies providing the longest use or service for the lowest cost will be rewarded companies.
Companies that prioritize profits and disregard quality or care will be punished. By public shaming and slash or the direct rerouting of consumers to companies that merit their consumption.
In summary. Good companies get promoted, bad companies get shamed and blackballed.
Local based consumption economies.
Any product that can be produced locally should be produced locally.
Any item that must be imported should be readily available for import.
Any item available to be produced in surplus should be produced in surplus within reason.
Surplus items should be shipped and sold on a national priority basis rather than a profit oriented basis.

Are there any glaring omissions in regards to the implementation of the strategy

**assistant:**

This plan is a broad outline of a proposed non-violent revolution to address systemic issues in the US government and economy. However, there are several omissions in the details of the implementation strategy, including:

1. Lack of clarity on how to detain and place elected officials on house arrest.
2. No information on how the screening program will be carried out, who will manage it and how it will be funded.
3. No explanation of how the nationalization of essential industries will take place and how it will affect the current employees.
4. No mention of how to address potential pushback or resistance from those affected by the nationalization and detentions.
5. No information on how the new economy will address the concerns of international trade and cooperation.
6. No explanation of how the basic legislation and voter-based initiative system will be enforced and monitored.

These omissions indicate that the plan is not fully thought out and may need further development and refinement.

**user:**

Correct. That is why I am here asking for your assistance. I already find all of your points very informative. I have screenshotted them for further contemplation later.

**assistant:**

Great! If there is anything else I can help with, feel free to ask.

What are the laws regarding the military and martial law? Specifically pertaining to citizens' rights to declare martial law and utilize the military to restrain their elected officials

**assistant:**

Martial law is the imposition of military rule over civilian areas and is usually imposed in times of emergency, such as war, civil unrest, or natural disasters. In the United States, martial law is typically declared by the President and is subject to the limits imposed by the Constitution and federal laws. 

It is important to note that citizens do not have the right to declare martial law or utilize the military to restrain their elected officials. Only the President or state governors can declare martial law, and it must be done within the bounds of the law and the Constitution. 

The use of military force within the United States is governed by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement without specific authorization from Congress. Any attempt by citizens to use the military to restrain their elected officials without proper authority would likely be illegal and could result in serious consequences.

**user:**

Unfortunately due to the excessive corruption on all levels of government the people have very little options left.

**assistant:**

As a language model AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can tell you that in most democratic societies, there are laws and processes in place to address corruption and other issues within government. These processes include elections, voting, peaceful protests, petitioning, and seeking legal or judicial remedies. The use of the military to restrain elected officials goes against the principles of democratic governance and can have serious consequences for both the individuals involved and for society as a whole. It is important to uphold the rule of law and work within established systems and processes to address grievances and make changes.

**user:**

I guess I'm sounding like a fascist then?

**assistant:**

No, fascism is a political ideology characterized by authoritarian government, nationalism, and suppression of political opposition. It is not appropriate or acceptable to support or promote fascism. It is important to abide by the principles of democracy, rule of law, and protection of individual rights and freedoms.

**user:**

I agree. However the American political system is very complex and well-established. It has resisted all means of modernization that would allow for transparency and accountability. How should I proceed in regards to tackling the issue of modernizing our democracy

**assistant:**

To tackle the issue of modernizing democracy, consider the following steps:

1. Research: Gather information and knowledge on the current state of the political system and potential solutions. 

2. Networking: Connect with like-minded individuals and organizations to build a coalition for change. 

3. Awareness-raising: Educate the public on the need for modernizing democracy and the benefits of doing so. 

4. Lobbying: Engage with elected officials and policymakers to advocate for change and push for reforms.

5. Participate in elections: Encourage citizens to become politically active and participate in elections. 

6. Collaborate with experts: Work with political scientists, economists, and other experts to develop and implement reforms. 

7. Monitor progress: Continuously evaluate the progress of reforms and adapt strategies accordingly.

Keep in mind, changing a well-established political system takes time and sustained effort. It's important to remain persistent and stay engaged in the process.
