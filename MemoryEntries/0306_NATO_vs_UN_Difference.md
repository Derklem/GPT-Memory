What is the difference between NATO and the United Nations

NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is a military alliance primarily focused on collective defense among its member states, while the United Nations (UN) is an international organization aimed at promoting peace, security, and cooperation among nations through diplomacy, development, and humanitarian efforts. NATO is more specifically concerned with security and defense, while the UN has a broader mandate covering various aspects of global governance.
