What makes our oceans salty


**assistant:**



The oceans are salty because of the presence of dissolved salts and minerals, which come from a variety of sources. 

The primary source of salt in the oceans is from the weathering and erosion of rocks on land. As water flows over rocks and soil, it picks up dissolved minerals such as sodium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium. These minerals are carried to the oceans through rivers and streams.

Volcanic eruptions and underwater vents also release minerals and gases into the ocean, contributing to its salinity. Additionally, oceanic crust is constantly being formed at mid-ocean ridges, where magma rises to the surface and solidifies, creating new crust. As this process occurs, minerals are released into the ocean, further increasing its salt content.

Despite the ongoing addition of salts to the ocean, its salinity has remained relatively constant over time due to a balance between inputs and outputs. Some of the ways that salt is removed from the ocean include precipitation, evaporation, and the formation of sea ice.
