# Assist Coding App Request

_Created: 2023-01-12T00:39:37+00:00_

**user:**

Could you assist me coding an app

**assistant:**

Of course! What kind of app are you looking to create, and what programming language(s) are you comfortable using? Additionally, what specific functionality are you looking to implement? It's difficult to provide a complete assistance without a more detailed question.


**user:**

I'm not entirely sure of the language required or the exact definition of the app. Can we start where I provide you a concept of it and you guide me with your best available information?

**assistant:**

Sure! I'd be happy to help guide you through the process of creating an app, even if you're not sure of the specific details yet. Please provide a brief overview of the concept for the app and I can help you determine what programming languages and tools might be best suited to the task, and give you an idea of what the development process might involve.


**user:**

The lineage library will be accessible by users as creators and observers. Creators will create a video of themselves detailing the occurrences of their life. At points in that video during playback it will pause allowing viewers to select a question thus guiding the conversation with the content creators.

**assistant:**

That sounds like an interesting concept! Depending on the specific requirements of your app, there are a few different programming languages and tools you could use to build it.

For the video recording and playback functionality, you could use a web-based video library such as webRTC, an open-source project that allows real-time communication through web browsers.

For the front-end of the app, which users will interact with, you could use a JavaScript framework such as React or Angular to build a responsive and user-friendly interface.

For the back-end of the app, you could use a server-side language such as Node.js, along with a framework such as Express, to handle the communication between the front-end and any databases or external APIs.

To store the user information and video recordings you could use a database such as MongoDB, SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite

This is a rough idea of what a tech stack for your app might look like, but there are many other options available, depending on the specific requirements of your app.

The development process will include several steps, such as defining the requirements of the app, creating a prototype, developing and testing the app, and deploying it to production.

Keep in mind that development of a real-world application involves a lot of details and will take a significant amount of time.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further help.


**user:**

I have already created a wireframe layout of the apps functionality. However, unfortunately that is a illustrator document. What program would you suggest for developing a prototype? 

**assistant:**

A wireframe is a great starting point for creating a prototype of your app! There are a few different options for creating a prototype of your app based on your wireframe.

One popular tool for creating interactive prototypes is Adobe XD. Adobe XD is a prototyping tool that is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite of tools, and it can be used to create wireframes, interactive prototypes, and design mockups for mobile and web apps. It allows you to import Illustrator files, and create interactive hotspots to simulate the app's behavior.

Another popular tool for creating interactive wireframes and prototypes is Figma. Figma is a browser-based design tool that allows you to create interactive wireframes and prototypes with a simple drag-and-drop interface. You can also import Illustrator file and use it as base layout. 

InVision Studio or Principle for mac also allow to create interactive prototype.

There are also other tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, or Moqups which you could use to create wireframes and interactive prototypes.

Ultimately, the choice of tool will depend on your experience with the tool, your budget, and the complexity of the design. I recommend you to try them and see which one you like most.

Please let me know if you need more information or have any question.
