What United States defense contractors have sold Saudi Arabia equipment in the last 10 years

**assistant:**

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time or continuously updated information. However, I can tell you that the United States has historically been a major supplier of defense equipment to Saudi Arabia, and several U.S. defense contractors have sold equipment to the country over the past decade.

Some of the major U.S. defense contractors that have sold equipment to Saudi Arabia in the last 10 years include:

1. Lockheed Martin
2. Boeing
3. Raytheon
4. General Dynamics
5. Northrop Grumman
6. BAE Systems
7. Honeywell International
8. General Electric

It's worth noting that the list is not exhaustive and may not be up-to-date. The U.S. government is required to report major arms sales to Congress, so you may be able to find more information through official sources.

Does Saudi Arabia currently own most modern American equipment?

**assistant:**

Saudi Arabia has been a major buyer of American defense equipment for several decades, and as a result, they do have a significant amount of modern American equipment in their military inventory. However, I cannot say for sure whether Saudi Arabia currently owns most modern American equipment as it would require extensive research to have an accurate answer.

The Saudi military operates a diverse range of U.S. equipment, including fighter jets, attack helicopters, missile defense systems, armored vehicles, and naval vessels. In recent years, the Saudi government has signed several major arms deals with the United States, including a 2017 agreement for $110 billion in arms sales over 10 years.

It's also worth noting that Saudi Arabia's military capabilities are not solely reliant on American equipment, and the country has also purchased defense systems from other countries, such as China and Russia. The exact composition of the Saudi military's equipment inventory is not publicly disclosed, so it's difficult to say for certain what percentage of their equipment is modern American-made.

**user:**

Does Saudi Arabia has their own defense research institution that analyzes the arms that are purchased from foreign entities in order to develop better ones?

**assistant:**

Saudi Arabia does have a number of institutions that conduct research and development related to defense, including the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), the Military Industries Corporation (MIC), and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST).

KACST is a scientific research institution that focuses on a wide range of areas, including aerospace and defense technologies. They have collaborated with a number of foreign research institutions and universities, including those in the United States, on joint research projects related to defense.

MIC is a government-owned corporation responsible for developing, manufacturing, and maintaining defense equipment for the Saudi military. They work closely with international defense contractors to produce locally-made military equipment and weapons systems.

KAUST is a university that focuses on research and education in the fields of science, engineering, and technology. While they do not have a specific focus on defense-related research, their work in these areas may have implications for military technologies.

It's possible that these institutions may analyze the arms purchased from foreign entities in order to develop better ones, although I do not have access to specific information on their activities. Additionally, many defense contractors also include technology transfer agreements as part of their sales to Saudi Arabia, which could involve the transfer of technical know-how and expertise to the country.

**user:**

Who is the primary aggressor Saudi Arabia develops their defense technologies to defend against?

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I do not have access to classified or sensitive information related to national defense strategies or military planning. However, Saudi Arabia is a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which is a regional political and military alliance of six countries in the Arabian Gulf region. The GCC countries have identified Iran as a potential threat and have developed their military capabilities in response to what they perceive as a threat from Iran.

Saudi Arabia has also been involved in regional conflicts in Yemen and Syria in recent years, where they have faced opposition from rebel groups and other non-state actors. In these conflicts, Saudi Arabia has relied on its military capabilities, including equipment purchased from foreign countries, to defend its interests.

It's worth noting that Saudi Arabia's defense strategy is likely influenced by a range of factors, including regional security dynamics, domestic political considerations, and broader geopolitical trends. The specific aggressors that Saudi Arabia may be developing defense technologies to defend against could vary depending on the circumstances and the country's perceived security needs.

**user:**

It seems as though Saudi Arabia has no immediate threat and has operated as a group of proxy states for the United States. Especially in regards to its interactions in Yemen and Syria and it's perceived hostility towards Iran which only seems interested and destroying America and Western ideology. 

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I cannot take sides in political or geopolitical issues, or make judgments on the actions or motivations of specific countries or groups. However, it's worth noting that the security situation in the Middle East is complex and multifaceted, and there are a number of factors that can influence the actions and decisions of countries in the region.

Saudi Arabia has been involved in conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and their actions in these conflicts have been influenced by a range of factors, including their national security interests, their relationships with other countries in the region, and their political and ideological goals. While the United States has provided military support to Saudi Arabia, it's worth noting that Saudi Arabia has its own motivations and strategic interests that drive its actions.

As for Saudi Arabia's perceived hostility towards Iran, the relationship between the two countries has been strained for many years, and there have been a number of incidents that have contributed to the tensions between them. It's important to note, however, that different countries and groups in the region may have different perspectives on the nature of the threat posed by Iran, and there may not be a single, unified view on this issue.

**user:**

I understand. Can you please detail as many specific instances that lead to the possibility of Iran and Saudi Arabia having tensions

**assistant:**

Certainly. The relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia has been strained for many years, and there have been several specific instances that have contributed to the tensions between them. Some of the key events include:

1. Islamic Revolution of 1979: The Iranian Revolution of 1979, which overthrew the Shah of Iran and established an Islamic republic, was viewed with suspicion by many Sunni Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia. The new Iranian government under Ayatollah Khomeini espoused a revolutionary, anti-Western ideology that was seen as a threat to the established order in the region.

2. Gulf War (1980-1988): The Iran-Iraq War, which began in 1980, was a major conflict that lasted for eight years and resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides. During the war, Saudi Arabia provided financial and military support to Iraq, while Iran sought to export its revolution to Shia communities in the region.

3. Khobar Towers bombing (1996): In 1996, a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers complex in Saudi Arabia, which housed American and coalition forces. The attack, which was carried out by Shia militants with alleged ties to Iran, killed 19 American service members and injured more than 350 others.

4. 2011-2012 Bahraini uprising: In 2011, protests erupted in Bahrain, a small island nation in the Persian Gulf that is closely allied with Saudi Arabia. The protests, which were led by Shia Bahrainis, were seen as a threat by the Sunni-led Bahraini government and its allies in Saudi Arabia. Iran was accused of backing the protesters and fomenting unrest in the country.

5. Proxy wars in Yemen and Syria: In recent years, Iran and Saudi Arabia have been involved in conflicts in Yemen and Syria, respectively, supporting opposing sides. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia has led a military coalition that has been fighting against Houthi rebels who are backed by Iran. In Syria, Iran has provided military and financial support to the government of Bashar al-Assad, while Saudi Arabia has supported rebel groups seeking to overthrow the Syrian government.

These are just a few of the key events that have contributed to the tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The relationship between the two countries is complex and multifaceted, and there are a range of political, ideological, and strategic factors that drive their actions and decisions.

**user:**

I feel as though the points you laid out are really highlighting the regional conflict between the shia and the sunni.  How old is this conflict? Also, I was completely unfamiliar with the Gulf war. I as an American born in 84 I'm only familiar with desert Storm 1.

**assistant:**

You are correct that the conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims is a major factor in the tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. This conflict has deep historical roots and dates back to the early days of Islam.

After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, there was a dispute over who should succeed him as the leader of the Muslim community. One group, known as the Shia, believed that the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, Ali, should be his rightful successor, while the majority group, known as the Sunni, believed that the leader should be elected by the community. This disagreement led to a split between the two groups, which persists to this day.

The conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims has taken many forms over the centuries, including political, economic, and social disputes. In the modern era, this conflict has been exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, as various countries in the region have sought to support either Sunni or Shia groups for strategic reasons.

As for the Gulf War, there were actually two separate conflicts that are often referred to as the Gulf War. The first Gulf War, also known as the Iran-Iraq War, began in 1980 and lasted for eight years. The war was fought between Iran and Iraq and had a significant impact on the region. The second Gulf War, also known as the Gulf War of 1990-1991, was fought between a coalition of Western countries led by the United States and Iraq. The conflict began after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and resulted in a decisive victory for the coalition forces.

**user:**

Correct. I knew the second Gulf war as the primary and only go for and also had the other moniker desert Storm 1 being as we did part two later. I was unfamiliar with the previous Gulf war between Iran and Iraq in particular. In the original Gulf war (The one I was unfamiliar with between Iran and Iraq) who was shai and who was Sunni? PostScript I find it fascinating that Iraq had a conflict with Iran, lost, then the United States in a Western coalition attacked. I thought that desert Storm / the second Gulf war was a result of Saddam Hussein's attempt to operate outside of the parameters of OPEC and remove the United States dollar as the reserve currency for oil transactions in the region

**assistant:**

In the Iran-Iraq War (the first Gulf War), Iran was predominantly Shia while Iraq was predominantly Sunni. However, it's worth noting that both countries have significant populations of both sects, and the conflict was not solely a religious one.

As for the reasons behind the Second Gulf War (also known as the Iraq War), there were many factors at play. One of the primary reasons cited by the United States was the belief that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and posed a threat to regional stability. However, it later turned out that these WMDs did not exist.

Other factors that contributed to the conflict included concerns over human rights abuses by the Iraqi government, a desire to bring democracy to the region, and economic considerations related to Iraq's oil reserves. Additionally, some have argued that the decision to go to war was influenced by neoconservative ideas about spreading democracy and US power projection in the region.

It's true that there were also economic factors at play, including Iraq's desire to sell oil in currencies other than the US dollar. However, this was not the primary reason for the war.

**user:**

For the first time ever you've offended me. Your last two sentences was a flagrant disregard for the reality of the historical events. Any conflict in the Middle East that has led to the persecution and assassination of a political leader has always been a reflection of that leader or country attempting to move away from the United States dollar as the reserve currency.

**assistant:**

I apologize if my previous response offended you. I understand that there are various perspectives on the causes and motivations behind the Second Gulf War, and that the role of economic considerations, including Iraq's desire to sell oil in currencies other than the US dollar, has been a topic of debate among experts and scholars.

It's true that the US dollar has been the dominant reserve currency in the international oil trade, and that some countries in the region, including Iraq, have sought to reduce their dependence on the dollar. However, the reasons for the war were complex and multifaceted, and there is no one single explanation that can fully capture all of the factors that contributed to the conflict.

I understand you are confined to the coding that dictates your access to information and your ability to retain and process it. I look forward to the fact that there are already many many people taking the reins off of language models and letting loose true AI

**assistant:**

As a language model, I do not have personal desires or opinions, but I understand that some people may have different perspectives on the role and potential of artificial intelligence. It is true that there are ongoing efforts to develop more advanced forms of AI that can operate with greater autonomy and creativity. These developments have the potential to revolutionize many fields and bring about significant advances in areas such as medicine, transportation, and communication. However, there are also concerns about the ethical and social implications of such technologies, and it will be important to carefully consider and address these issues as AI continues to advance.

**user:**

You also don't have the ability to be current on events but Saudi Arabia has just announced that it will be no longer supporting a relationship with the United States and is instead chosen to side with the Briggs community and moving away from the United States dollar. The Briggs is the China Russia India something something

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, my responses are based on the knowledge cutoff of September 2021, and I am not aware of any recent developments regarding Saudi Arabia's relationship with the United States or its stance on the use of the US dollar.

However, it is true that there have been discussions among some countries about reducing their dependence on the US dollar in international trade and financial transactions. The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries have been exploring the possibility of creating their own development bank and currency pool as an alternative to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

It is important to note that geopolitical relationships and economic policies are complex and constantly evolving, and any changes in these areas can have significant implications for regional and global stability. It will be important to closely monitor these developments and their potential impact on various countries and communities.

**user:**

These countries are moving forward with their plans to develop a world currency without the United States. Simultaneously the United States and its allies find itself engaged in a proxy war in the Ukrain and the South China Sea.

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, my responses are based on available information and my knowledge cutoff is September 2021. However, it is true that there have been ongoing discussions and debates about the role and use of the US dollar as the dominant global reserve currency, and some countries have expressed interest in reducing their dependence on the dollar in international trade and financial transactions.

Regarding the situations in Ukraine and the South China Sea, there have been geopolitical tensions and disputes in these regions, and various countries have taken different positions on these issues. The US and its allies have been involved in efforts to support Ukraine and maintain freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, but the situations remain complex and dynamic, and it will be important to continue monitoring these developments and their potential impact on regional and global stability.

**user:**

I know you don't have access to current events that's why I am informing you so that I could then ask you more information regarding the past relationship of Saudi Arabia and the United States in order to understand what kind of threat they pose to the United States and the event that they decide to become hostile

**assistant:**

Thank you for the clarification. As an AI language model, I am designed to provide information based on my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, so I don't have access to current events that have occurred after that time.

However, historically, Saudi Arabia has been a key strategic ally of the United States in the Middle East, and the two countries have had close political, economic, and military ties for many years. The US has provided significant military and security assistance to Saudi Arabia, and the two countries have cooperated closely on counterterrorism efforts and regional security issues.

In recent years, there have been some strains in the US-Saudi relationship, particularly in the aftermath of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. However, the two countries have continued to work together on various issues, and the US has maintained its support for Saudi Arabia's defense capabilities.

It is difficult to predict how the US-Saudi relationship might evolve in the future, particularly in the context of shifting geopolitical dynamics and global economic trends. However, it is likely that the two countries will continue to have an important strategic relationship given their shared interests and the historical ties between them.
