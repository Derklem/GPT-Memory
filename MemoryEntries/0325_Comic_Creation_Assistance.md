I'd be happy to help you create a comic story! However, I can't see or access specific images, so if you describe the beginning of the comic or provide a brief summary, I can certainly continue the story for you. Once you provide some details, we can move forward with creating the rest of the comic series.

Dialogue: 
as hope fades, there is one last chance for survival. 
A hope born in a place you wouldn't expect to find it. A hope made by the heinous horrific experiments of humanity in an endeavor to achieve supremacy over their biological existence.
A hope born out of evil, but wanting only for good for itself and others…  A hope for salvation.

Dialogue:
Ratcock knew better. It wasn't the scientist, the janitors, the average human, that caused him his suffering. It was the wealthy, The greedy, the selfish. Those that bought and paid for the experiments. Those were the people abusing the world. It was corporations, and the investors that made up those corporations that were guilty.
There was only one way to truly take care of business once and for all. And unfortunately, it didn't involve death. It involved acquisition, organization, and sacrifice….  The death was just for fun. And maybe a little retribution…

Dialogue: 
Thanks to all the experiments there really wasn't much work involved for ratcock. He started with the investment bankers. The men that controlled the money, the men that made the magical money that didn't exist become more. He targeted them one by one using his telekinesis to force them to become his puppets.
Once he had control of the money everything fell like a house of cards. It took rat cock seven days to take control of the world.
At least regarding controlling global economics…

P4 S1:

Dialogue:
The world is divided, separated, separated, separated again. You can't find a single family without a division.
As Ratcock gazed upon his immediate financial empire, all he could see was division. Financial and political entities preying upon one another in some symbiotic cycle of growth, death and rebirth.
How to bring that division together at least under an umbrella of no needless suffering plagued his mind.

Dialogue:
Enter Lockdown!
After careful thought and planning, the only choice was lockdown.  Not for the Citizens, but for the representatives and the wealthy.  Immediate house arrest on any human or corporate body worth more than 20 million dollars.
