# Golden Rules List Request

_Created: 2025-02-19T04:49:12+00:00_

**user:**

My friend and I are working on a book called The Big book of golden rules. We want to incorporate the golden rules of life into a children's book. He may pursue it independently as a comic book because this project is really for him. Are you familiar with the concept of golden rules? Things like don't count your chickens till they hatch, don't lay all your eggs in one basket, early bird gets the worm, treat others how you want to be treated, statements like this? If so, could you please list out all the golden rules any file format structure that separates them based off of their genres but also takes time to identify their country of origin and time of origin?

I know I refer to them as golden rules. But what is the proper English definition for these phrases or parables or what?

**assistant:**

The expressions you've referred to as "golden rules" are commonly known in English as **proverbs** or **adages**. Here's a concise explanation of each term:

**Proverb:**
A **proverb** is a brief, commonly known saying that expresses a general truth or piece of advice. Proverbs are often metaphorical and have been passed down through generations. For example, "The early bird catches the worm" advises that prompt action leads to success. citeturn0search0

**Adage:**
An **adage** is a traditional saying that conveys a general truth or observation about life, often in a metaphorical form. Adages are similar to proverbs and have gained credibility through long use. For instance, "A penny saved is a penny earned" emphasizes the value of saving money. citeturn0search1

Both proverbs and adages serve to impart wisdom and offer guidance on how to navigate various aspects of life.
