# Horses Show Teeth: Dominance

**user:**

There are several horses next door I have been feeding them and picked grasses that they enjoy. I finally fed them apples and carrots. The dominant mayor showed her teeth to me after the first carrot. It was terrifying but I believe it was a sign of endearment. What does it mean?

When a horse shows its teeth, it can have several meanings depending on the context and the horse's body language. Here's a breakdown of possible interpretations:

1. **Flehmen Response**: Sometimes horses curl back their lips and show their teeth as part of the Flehmen response, where they are trying to better detect scents. However, this is less common when food is involved and more related to strong smells.

2. **Dominance or Aggression**: Horses often show their teeth as a sign of dominance or aggression, especially if they feel their space is being invaded or they want to assert control over a resource (like food). The dominant mare might be signaling her dominance over the food you are offering.

3. **Anticipation or Excitement**: Some horses show their teeth when they are excited or eagerly anticipating something they enjoy, such as a treat. This might look similar to a smile or a grimace.

4. **Pain or Discomfort**: If a horse is experiencing pain or discomfort, particularly dental issues, it might show its teeth in response to the discomfort.

Given that the mare showed her teeth after receiving a carrot, it is most likely a sign of dominance, especially if she is the dominant horse in the herd. She could be asserting her control over the food or over the interaction. While it might have seemed terrifying, understanding the horse's body language and the context is crucial. 

When feeding horses, always be cautious and respectful of their space, especially with dominant horses. It's best to observe their reactions and adjust your behavior to ensure a safe and positive interaction.

I'm separated by a wire fence that has three layers of barbed wire that I and the horses regularly hate based off of our engagement with it. I think the idea of the display of dominance makes sense regarding this particular mares dominance over the other two mares.

**assistant:**

Given that you're separated by a wire fence, the mare's display of dominance makes sense in the context of her interaction with both you and the other horses. Even through a fence, horses can and do communicate their social hierarchies and expectations.

Here are a few tips to keep in mind when feeding and interacting with horses, especially when separated by a fence:

1. **Respect Their Space**: Always be mindful of the dominant horse's need to assert her position. Giving her space and ensuring she feels in control can reduce any potential aggressive displays.

2. **Feed Equally and Separately**: If possible, try to feed the horses in a way that allows each one to have their own share without having to compete. This can minimize the dominant horse's need to assert control over the food.

3. **Watch Body Language**: Continue to observe the mare's body language. Ears pinned back, aggressive movements, or other signs of agitation should be taken as cues to step back and give her space.

4. **Stay Safe**: While the fence provides some protection, always ensure your hands and fingers are safe from potential bites, and avoid leaning too close to the wire or barbed sections.

5. **Positive Reinforcement**: Gradually building trust with the horses through consistent, calm, and positive interactions can help. Over time, the horses may become more comfortable and less likely to display dominance aggressively.

By being aware of these dynamics and adjusting your approach accordingly, you can maintain a safe and positive relationship with the horses, even through a fence.
