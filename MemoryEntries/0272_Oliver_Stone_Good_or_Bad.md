Oliver Stone, born on September 15, 1946, is 77 years old as of 2024. Assessing whether someone is a "good person" is inherently subjective and complex. Oliver Stone is a well-known film director, producer, and screenwriter, acclaimed for his work on films such as "Platoon," "Born on the Fourth of July," and "JFK." He has been both praised and criticized for his controversial themes and strong political views.

Some see him as a courageous filmmaker who tackles difficult subjects and questions mainstream narratives, while others criticize him for being too polemical or for perceived biases in his work. Personal views on his character may vary widely based on perspectives on his professional conduct, public statements, and the themes he explores in his films.
