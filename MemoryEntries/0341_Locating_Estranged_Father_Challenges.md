**user:**

I'm attempting to locate my estranged father. He is a former Air Force military police officer as well as a police officer, and then retired author. He has gone to great lengths to eliminate himself from the internet. I am only able to find information that he is not able to rescind due to the fact that it is in the hands of a private entity on private web pages for his authorship. What would be the best means outside of the white pages in order to identify locate and communicate with him

Locating someone who has intentionally removed themselves from the internet can be challenging, but there are a few strategies you can try. Here are some suggestions:

1. Contact his known acquaintances: Reach out to any friends, family members, or colleagues who may have maintained contact with your father. They might have more information about his whereabouts or be able to provide you with updated contact details.

2. Hire a private investigator: Consider enlisting the services of a professional investigator who specializes in finding missing persons. They have access to various databases and search methods that can help track down individuals, even those who have intentionally hidden their online presence.

3. Check public records: While your father may have removed himself from the internet, there may still be public records available that could offer clues to his current location. These can include property records, court documents, or voter registrations. Visit local government offices or use online public record databases to search for any relevant information.

4. Utilize social media networks: Even if your father has avoided using social media platforms, there's a chance that other family members, friends, or acquaintances might be connected to him online. Reach out to these individuals and discreetly inquire if they have any information or if they can relay a message to him on your behalf.

5. Explore professional networks: Given your father's background as a military police officer and police officer, consider reaching out to individuals within those networks. You can contact Air Force or law enforcement associations or organizations and explain your situation. They may be willing to assist or provide guidance on how to locate your father.

6. Attend relevant events or gatherings: If your father is an author, he might occasionally participate in literary events, conferences, or book signings. Keep an eye out for such events in your area or even broader regions and consider attending. There's a possibility that you may be able to meet him in person or connect with someone who has information about his current whereabouts.

Remember to approach the search with sensitivity and respect for your father's privacy. If he has intentionally distanced himself, there may be reasons for it, and he may not wish to be found. Respect his decision if he does not want to establish contact.

Number one I am in contact with some of his siblings of which he communicates to none of them. He has no living parents so that's also not an option. Number two in the event that I am going to hire a private investigator in Virginia what would be your top five recommendations in regards to credible reliable affordable investigators?
Number three regarding public records, in the event that I know he has bought and sold a property in the state of Virginia what specific web pages can I access in order to garner or gain information for public records for the state of Virginia. I know he bought and sold a home but he still resides in Virginia
#4 Social media is worthless based off of the fact that he is eliminated himself digitally.
#5 is actually a great idea, I know my father loves to collect police patches and has most likely visited each and every police station in the state of Virginia.
I totally respect my father's privacy, I have no intention of asking him for anything or even communicating with him. I'm simply concerned and curious regarding his well-being, being as that as an internet sleuth I have maintained constant awareness of this of his situation until he decided to remove himself. I know his removal is not a reflection of my observation because at no time have I ever contacted him or giving him any reason to suspect that I was completely aware of where he was and what he was doing.

I apologize for any misunderstanding. I can provide some general guidance, but it's important to note that I cannot endorse or recommend specific private investigators or websites. However, I can offer you some tips to help you find reliable investigators and access public records in Virginia:

1. Research reputable private investigation agencies: Look for established agencies with positive reviews and a track record of successful cases. You can search online directories, such as the Virginia Association of Licensed Private Investigators or the Better Business Bureau, to find licensed and reputable investigators in Virginia.

2. Seek recommendations: Ask for recommendations from trusted sources, such as attorneys or law enforcement professionals, who may have worked with private investigators before. Their insights and referrals can help you find credible investigators in your area.

3. Initial consultation: Contact a few investigators and schedule an initial consultation. Discuss your specific case, inquire about their experience with missing persons cases, and ask for client references if available. This will help you gauge their professionalism and expertise.

4. Verify licenses and credentials: Ensure that any investigator you consider hiring is properly licensed and has the necessary credentials to operate legally in Virginia. You can verify their licenses with the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services or the appropriate regulatory body.

Regarding public records in Virginia, here are some resources you can explore:

- Virginia Circuit Courts: The Circuit Courts maintain records related to property transactions, including real estate purchases and sales. You can visit the website of the Virginia Judicial System (courts.state.va.us) and search for the circuit court in the county where the property was located. They often have online databases or contact information for obtaining public records.

- County Clerk's Office: Contact the County Clerk's Office in the specific county where your father's property transactions took place. They can provide access to property records, deeds, and other relevant documents.

- Virginia Department of Health: The Virginia Department of Health might have records related to births, marriages, and divorces. You can visit their website (vdh.virginia.gov) for more information or contact their vital records division for assistance.

Remember to follow any procedures or guidelines outlined by these organizations to access the desired public records.

I hope these suggestions help you in your search for public records and a reputable private investigator. Good luck in your efforts to locate your estranged father and find peace of mind regarding his well-being.
