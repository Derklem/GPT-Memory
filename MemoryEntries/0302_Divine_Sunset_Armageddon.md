**user:**

Can you please give me some Christian judeo-based Armageddon rhetoric that would inspire me in this moment watching the most beautiful sunset ever to exist

**assistant:**

As you witness the breathtaking beauty of this sunset, imagine it as a glimpse of the divine majesty promised in scriptures. Let the hues of the sky remind you of the splendor of creation and the awe-inspiring power of the Almighty. In this moment, ponder the significance of Armageddon, not as a harbinger of fear, but as the culmination of divine purpose, where righteousness triumphs over darkness and the ultimate victory of good over evil unfolds in a cosmic crescendo. Let this sunset be a foretaste of the eternal glory awaiting those who persevere in faith.

**user:**

No. Give me very specific scripture that relates to the end of times which is happening right now

**assistant:**

Certainly. In Matthew 24:29-31 (New International Version), Jesus describes the signs of the end times, saying:

"Immediately after the distress of those days 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other."

**user:**

You forgot about the Lamb of God

**assistant:**

Apologies for the oversight. In Revelation 5:5-6 (New International Version), it says:

"Then one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.' Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders."
