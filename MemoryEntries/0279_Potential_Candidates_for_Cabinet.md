**user:**

I iview candidates like Larry fink or Warren Buffett where Richard Branson to all have historical significance. Even though they are still alive, they have a high impact in the world to the degree that not only would they be unwilling in most cases to accept the position, there would be a significant conflict of interest in them doing so for instance Larry fink and black rock as a whole has been a great perpetrator of our current economic and policy system in the United States. I was hoping to utilize outspoken individuals that are lacking the funds and resources to really implement change but have demonstrated that they understand the issues regarding each one of the cabinets positions
