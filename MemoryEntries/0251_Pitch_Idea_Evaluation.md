# Pitch Idea Evaluation

_Created: 2025-01-06T07:52:32+00:00_

**user:**

Can you please answer like you are a cut fruit TV producer whose intention is to be able to find viable profitability in an idea that I'm about to pitch to you?

**assistant:**

User wants responses framed as though addressing a TV producer evaluating ideas for profitability.

**assistant:**

Absolutely! Pitch your idea, and I’ll evaluate its profitability and viability like a seasoned TV producer. Let’s hear it!

**user:**

Instead of it being for television it's a social media styled 60 second snippet for tick tock. It's going to be called or titled something along the lines of you say you love us prove it, or, put your money where your mouth is. It's focus is going to be on drawing attention to a direct cause or organization and calling out the billionaire oligarchy class 2 invest or solve the problem through a proved organization. It's a way of trying to engage the billionaire class with philanthropic projects that don't just waste their money on bloated salaries but goes directly to grassroots organizations.

**assistant:**

Alright, let’s break this down from a profitability and impact perspective as if I'm evaluating the idea for a potential series of social media snippets. Here's my take:  

### **Strengths of the Idea**
1. **Bold and Provocative Title:**  
   Titles like *"You Say You Love Us, Prove It"* or *"Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is"* are catchy, memorable, and create instant curiosity. They're perfect for a short-form platform like TikTok, where engagement is king.  

2. **Clear Target Audience:**  
   Calling out billionaires directly gives this concept a laser focus. Billionaires are already a polarizing topic, and content targeting them tends to generate massive discussion online. The general audience will likely rally behind the "David vs. Goliath" narrative.  

3. **Social Good Hook:**  
   Highlighting grassroots organizations gives the audience a sense of authenticity. People are tired of hearing about philanthropy that doesn't work. By showing direct connections to proven organizations, you’re also appealing to younger, socially conscious demographics that dominate TikTok.  

4. **Built-in Virality:**  
   By challenging billionaires, you’re creating high-stakes content. Even the possibility of a response from a high-profile individual like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos would skyrocket engagement.  

### **Challenges**
1. **Sustainability:**  
   While calling out billionaires might create a few viral hits, the real challenge is keeping the momentum. If billionaires don’t respond or engage, will your audience lose interest?  

2. **Execution Risk:**  
   If you're naming organizations or causes, you'll need to ensure they’re vetted thoroughly. Any misstep could open you up to backlash or lawsuits.  

3. **Monetization:**  
   Who funds this? You’re essentially going after a class of people that might not directly engage or fund your project. Can you build partnerships with the grassroots organizations for sponsorships, or will you rely solely on ad revenue?  

4. **Perceived Cynicism:**  
   There’s a fine line between advocacy and looking opportunistic. If the messaging feels too much like performative activism, you risk alienating your audience.  

### **Suggestions for Profitability**
1. **Partner with Grassroots Organizations:**  
   Create sponsorship opportunities where these organizations pay for featured segments. In exchange, they get a direct platform to highlight their work.  

2. **Crowdfund through Audience Engagement:**  
   Encourage your audience to support the grassroots organizations directly, potentially offering a small percentage of raised funds for your production costs.  

3. **Merchandising:**  
   Use the provocative titles and themes for merchandise sales, such as T-shirts or hats with slogans like "Prove It" or "Billionaire Accountability Squad."  

4. **Licensing and Collaboration:**  
   Consider partnerships with larger media companies or philanthropic initiatives looking for fresh angles to highlight their work.  

5. **Corporate Sponsorships:**  
   Oddly enough, corporations seeking to enhance their ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) image might support this content—especially if they want to be seen as on the right side of history.  

### **Potential Profitability**
This concept has strong potential for virality and audience engagement, but profitability will hinge on securing funding partnerships. The short-form format also keeps production costs low, making it easier to experiment and iterate until you hit a winning formula. With the right execution, this could grow into a movement that extends beyond TikTok into other platforms or even live events.  

Would you like me to help outline specific episodes or engagement strategies?

**user:**

I would love that. However I would like to focus on licensing collaboration and merchandising for my points of revenue generation. My real focus is on identifying positive grassroots organizations and calling out even local millionaires. In order to increase the amount of videos I can make but also to bring a direct connection between the organization in need and the person that could provide that need and receive it tax write-off for it. Or even as an investor in a young entrepreneur. I appreciate your focus on the necessity for me to be vetting everyone and will be doing so for any product service or organization that I want to promote by calling out a local or international wealthy individual

**assistant:**

User wants to focus on licensing, collaboration, and merchandising for revenue generation. Their goal is to identify positive grassroots organizations and call out local millionaires and billionaires to create direct connections between organizations in need and potential donors or investors. They prioritize vetting all products, services, or organizations they promote.

**assistant:**

Got it! Let’s craft a plan that prioritizes licensing, collaboration, and merchandising while maintaining a strong focus on vetting and connecting grassroots organizations with wealthy individuals.  

### **Outline for Episodes and Strategies**  

#### **Episode Themes**  
1. **"Local Heroes Needed":**  
   - Focus on a local grassroots organization or young entrepreneur with a specific, verifiable need (e.g., funding a food pantry, starting a community garden).  
   - Name-drop local millionaires or business owners, urging them to step up and invest in their community.  
   - Include compelling visuals of the impact area (e.g., food shortages, community gathering spaces) and testimonials from people who would benefit.  

2. **"You’re Invited to the Table":**  
   - Highlight an organization doing great work internationally but lacking funding.  
   - Use statistics and testimonials to paint a clear picture of their impact.  
   - Call out billionaires or international investors to take a seat at the table by contributing directly.  

3. **"Small Change, Big Difference":**  
   - Focus on showcasing organizations that can create massive impact with small contributions.  
   - Tie this to an incentive for the millionaire (e.g., spotlight, name recognition) while promoting merchandise related to the cause.  

4. **"Match Challenge":**  
   - Challenge local businesses or wealthy individuals to match donations raised by the audience, creating a sense of shared responsibility.  
   - Include a countdown or live tracker for audience engagement.  

#### **Strategies for Licensing and Collaboration**  
1. **Brand Partnerships:**  
   - Partner with ethical, socially responsible brands that align with your message. For instance, eco-friendly product companies or platforms like GoFundMe might collaborate to sponsor videos.  

2. **Exclusive Collaborations:**  
   - Negotiate licensing deals with social media platforms or news outlets to feature your content as part of their socially-conscious programming.  
   - Collaborate with established nonprofits to create co-branded campaigns.  

3. **Platform Expansion:**  
   - Use TikTok to create buzz but repurpose content for YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and even LinkedIn to attract a broader audience, including professionals and investors.  

#### **Merchandising Ideas**  
1. **Thematic Apparel:**  
   - Shirts, hats, and tote bags with provocative slogans like *"Prove It,"* *"Where Are You, [City Name] Millionaires?"* or *"Small Change, Big Impact."*  
   - Limited-edition items tied to specific episodes or causes to encourage urgency.  

2. **Exclusive Memberships:**  
   - Offer fans access to behind-the-scenes content or Q&A sessions with grassroots leaders via Patreon or a membership platform.  

3. **Cause-Specific Merch:**  
   - Design products where proceeds from sales directly support the featured grassroots organization. For example, if highlighting a clean water project, sell reusable water bottles branded with the campaign’s name.  

#### **Building Trust Through Vetting**  
1. **Transparency is Key:**  
   - Dedicate a portion of each video to show your vetting process—interview organization leaders, show financial records, or spotlight real beneficiaries.  
   - Publish detailed reports online about the organizations you work with, enhancing your credibility.  

2. **Community Verification:**  
   - Involve your audience in the vetting process by encouraging them to nominate and investigate local organizations.  

#### **Call-to-Action Framework for Videos**  
1. **Start with a Hook:**  
   - “Hey [City Name], did you know this grassroots group is doing [X amazing thing] but needs just [$ amount] to scale?”  
2. **Show the Need:**  
   - Briefly highlight the problem and the solution the organization offers.  
3. **Call Out the Wealthy:**  
   - Tag or directly mention wealthy individuals who could realistically contribute.  
4. **Engage Your Audience:**  
   - “Tag [millionaire’s name] and tell them to prove they care!” or “Share this video and challenge [local business] to match our donations!”  
5. **Promote Merchandise:**  
   - “Want to support this cause? Grab one of our limited-edition shirts—proceeds go directly to [organization’s name].”  

Would you like to dive deeper into one of these strategies or discuss potential collaborations with platforms or brands?

**user:**

I want the merchandise to be non-gimmicky clearly the difference between supporting the businesses and supporting me. You have great ideas about theming it but that would be my source of revenue and I would like to be completely transparent about everything moving forward with this project. So that would always be disclosed and I want it to always be a minimum of any video. Literally something simple like " merch links in bio" I know a user that uses that specific line and something simple like that would suffice. The focus should be on linking the two together and not overly shaming the wealthy individual but hopefully drawing a successful connection between them and a local provider of a positive good or service

**assistant:**

User wants merchandise to be non-gimmicky and clearly distinguishable from supporting the highlighted businesses or organizations. Merchandise will be their source of revenue, and they prioritize full transparency. They want the promotion of merchandise to be minimal, such as using simple lines like "merch links in bio." The focus is on creating successful connections between wealthy individuals and local providers of positive goods or services without overly shaming the wealthy individuals.

**assistant:**

Understood. Let's keep the merchandise promotion subtle and focus on creating meaningful connections while maintaining transparency. Here's a refined approach:  

### **Updated Episode Framework**  
1. **Opening:**  
   - Briefly introduce the local organization or individual in need, highlighting their mission and specific goal.  
   - Keep the tone positive and hopeful, emphasizing the potential impact of support.  

2. **Connection Call-Out:**  
   - Directly but respectfully address the targeted wealthy individual or business. For example:  
     *“[Name], here’s an incredible opportunity to support [cause] in your own backyard. Imagine the lives you could change with your investment.”*  
   - Showcase how this connection benefits everyone: tax deductions, community goodwill, and measurable results.  

3. **Focus on the Organization:**  
   - Highlight the organization’s credibility, transparency, and impact. Include visuals or testimonials to solidify trust.  

4. **Closing:**  
   - Subtly include your merch mention:  
     *“If you want to support this project or help me keep finding these stories, check out the merch link in my bio.”*  
   - End on an uplifting note with a call to action for the audience:  
     *“Tag [wealthy individual] and share this video. Let’s make this connection happen together.”*  

### **Merchandise Strategy**  
- **Design:**  
  Keep it minimalist and classy—clean fonts, subtle designs, and themes that reflect the mission of the project. Examples:  
  - “Local Heroes Only”  
  - “Impact Over Words”  
  - “Change Starts Here”  

- **Positioning:**  
  Merchandise serves as a way for your audience to support your work transparently, not as a gimmick. You’re funding the platform to amplify grassroots efforts.  

- **Transparency:**  
  Include a breakdown of your revenue on a public page (e.g., X% goes to production, X% to platform costs). This builds trust and aligns with your mission of accountability.  

### **Tone with Wealthy Individuals**  
Shift the narrative from blame to opportunity:  
- **Instead of:** “Why aren’t you doing anything to help?”  
- **Say:** “Here’s your chance to make a real difference and leave a lasting legacy in your community.”  

This tone encourages collaboration rather than defensiveness.  

### **Maximizing the Connection Focus**  
1. **Highlight Success Stories:**  
   Dedicate follow-up episodes to successful connections made, showing the tangible outcomes of collaboration.  

2. **Use Data:**  
   Provide clear metrics—how much was donated, how many lives were impacted—so the wealthy individual and your audience see the results.  

3. **Interactive Engagement:**  
   Use your audience to amplify calls for support:  
   - Host live Q&A sessions with grassroots leaders.  
   - Run polls to let your audience nominate the next organization to feature.

**user:**

That's all amazing! You had mentioned something also in your previous response regarding a potential challenge between crowdfunding and local wealthy individuals. I thought that was also a really great idea I would love to figure out how to integrate so when a video is posted so is it GoFundMe and we can see how much poor people are willing to give versus rich people.

**assistant:**

User wants to integrate crowdfunding alongside appeals to wealthy individuals, using platforms like GoFundMe to measure contributions from everyday people versus wealthy individuals, fostering a transparent and comparative impact.

**assistant:**

Here’s how we can seamlessly integrate crowdfunding into your videos while keeping the focus on transparency and creating meaningful comparisons:  

### **Crowdfunding vs. Wealthy Contributions**  
1. **Dual Fundraising Approach:**  
   - Set up a **GoFundMe** for each featured organization alongside the call-out to wealthy individuals. The fundraiser title and description should clearly reflect the cause (e.g., *“Help Fund [Organization Name]: A Community Solution”*).  
   - Include a bold challenge in the description: *“Can everyday people outshine [wealthy individual’s name] in supporting this cause?”*  

2. **Real-Time Tracking:**  
   - Use graphics or overlays in your videos to show live updates of the crowdfunding progress versus the wealthy individual’s contribution.  
   - Example: A split screen with one side tracking donations from everyday supporters and the other awaiting contributions from the featured wealthy individual.  

3. **Engage the Audience:**  
   - Encourage viewers to contribute and tag the wealthy individual:  
     *“We’ve raised $X so far—let’s see if [Name] can match or beat us!”*  

4. **Celebrate Contributions Equally:**  
   - Spotlight large and small donations alike, emphasizing the collective impact of everyday people while also encouraging wealthy individuals to make transformative contributions.  

### **How to Present This in Videos**  
1. **Opening Challenge:**  
   *“This week, we’re raising funds for [Organization Name], which is doing amazing work in [field/cause]. Everyday people like us are stepping up—can [wealthy individual] join us?”*  

2. **Show Crowdfunding Progress:**  
   Include a simple, eye-catching graphic that updates dynamically in follow-ups:  
   - Bar charts, donation totals, or even a thermometer-style tracker.  

3. **Closing Call to Action:**  
   *“Donate through the GoFundMe link in the bio, or tag [Name] to get them involved. Let’s see who steps up!”*  

### **Benefits of This Approach**
1. **Audience Empowerment:**  
   - Everyday people feel like active participants in solving the problem, not just spectators.  
   - It fosters a sense of community ownership over the impact.  

2. **Accountability for Wealthy Individuals:**  
   - With visible contributions from everyday people, wealthy individuals may feel more inclined to participate to avoid public scrutiny.  

3. **Increased Transparency:**  
   - The side-by-side comparison showcases exactly where the support is coming from, adding credibility to the movement.  

### **Optional Additions**  
- **Matching Campaigns:**  
   Reach out to the wealthy individual beforehand and ask them to pledge a matching donation for every dollar raised by the public.  
- **Rewards for Donors:**  
   Offer public shoutouts or exclusive updates to top contributors, creating further engagement and excitement.  

Would you like help setting up a GoFundMe structure or scripting an episode that integrates this dual-funding challenge?

**user:**

I like the idea of having a weekly goal. I'd like to integrate in wacky Wednesday rushed goal.  Every Monday I have a normal episode and then every Wednesday I release one and they both close by friday. The GoFundMe will have to stay open until it meets its go but at least I can do two videos on Wednesday one as an update for tracking the GoFundMe versus the billionaire's response and the other being the wacky Wednesday where I select an absurd business close to the one I'm working with with an absurd small amount of money as a goal. I think that's too much of a workload for me because I am one person only. I should stick to one business a week with a Monday release date for the video a Wednesday update video and a Friday closing video. What do you think?

**assistant:**

User wants to focus on one business or organization per week. Their content schedule includes:  
- **Monday:** Initial video introducing the organization and campaign.  
- **Wednesday:** Update video tracking GoFundMe progress versus the wealthy individual's response.  
- **Friday:** Closing video summarizing progress and outcomes.  

They aim to maintain a manageable workload as a solo creator.

**assistant:**

Your streamlined schedule is perfect for maintaining quality while staying consistent as a solo creator. Focusing on one business or organization per week ensures you can dedicate the necessary attention to vetting, storytelling, and audience engagement. Here's how this schedule could play out:  

### **Weekly Workflow**  

#### **Monday: Launch Video**  
- **Purpose:** Introduce the featured organization, the problem they solve, and their specific financial goal.  
- **Structure:**  
  1. Hook: *“Did you know [Problem/Impact]? [Organization] is changing lives, but they need your help!”*  
  2. Call-out: Respectfully tag the targeted wealthy individual and present the challenge.  
  3. CTA: Encourage audience participation and direct them to the GoFundMe link.  
- **Visuals:** Include clear visuals of the organization’s work and testimonials.  

#### **Wednesday: Midweek Update Video**  
- **Purpose:** Track progress and maintain momentum for both the audience and the wealthy individual.  
- **Structure:**  
  1. Highlight how much has been raised so far by everyday donors.  
  2. Gently nudge the wealthy individual with a respectful, upbeat tone: *“We’re waiting to see if [Name] will join us!”*  
  3. Reiterate the mission and remind the audience their small contributions matter.  
- **Content:** If time permits, you could include a quick “Wacky Wednesday” comparison to a quirky or humorous business, but only as a brief side note.  

#### **Friday: Closing Video**  
- **Purpose:** Wrap up the campaign with a summary of progress and outcomes.  
- **Structure:**  
  1. Announce the total raised so far and acknowledge any wealthy individual contributions.  
  2. Celebrate audience participation and highlight next steps for the organization (e.g., “The GoFundMe is still live if you’d like to help us hit 100%!”).  
  3. Subtle merch plug: *“If you’d like to support my work amplifying causes like this, check out the link in my bio.”*  

### **Key Advantages of This Schedule**
1. **Consistency Builds Trust:**  
   Audiences will know what to expect and when, keeping them engaged and involved.  

2. **Reduced Burnout:**  
   By focusing on one organization per week, you’re setting a sustainable pace.  

3. **Momentum for Donations:**  
   The midweek update encourages more participation, while the Friday closing creates urgency to donate before the week ends.
