**user:**

Have there been any noted significant side effects?

**assistant:**

Zesty Paws Mobility Bites generally receive positive reviews for their effectiveness in improving joint health and mobility in dogs, especially seniors. However, some potential side effects have been noted. These primarily include mild digestive issues such as loose stools, gas, or diarrhea when first introducing the supplement【15†source】【16†source】【17†source】.

Most dogs tolerate the bites well, and these side effects typically subside after a short period. If digestive upset persists, reducing the dosage or spreading out the treats throughout the day may help. Additionally, since the bites contain glucosamine derived from shellfish, dogs with shellfish allergies might experience adverse reactions, so it's recommended to consult with a veterinarian before starting the supplement【15†source】【16†source】.
