What is the 9th amendment


**assistant:**

The 9th amendment to the United States Constitution states that "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights retained by the people." This amendment is intended to protect individual rights that are not specifically listed in the Constitution, such as the right to privacy. It serves as a reminder that the Constitution is not a comprehensive list of all of the rights held by citizens and that the government cannot use the fact that a right is not listed in the Constitution as an excuse to infringe upon it.
