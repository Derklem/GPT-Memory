Is CVS a good option for gaining experience and educational assistance?

**assistant:**

CVS Health (CVS) is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the United States, and it may be a good option for gaining experience and educational assistance in the field of pharmacy.

CVS offers a variety of opportunities for pharmacy students and professionals, such as internships, externships, and residency programs. These programs provide hands-on experience in a real-world setting and can help individuals gain valuable skills and knowledge in the field. Additionally, CVS also has its own pharmacy technician training program, which can provide individuals with the education and training needed to become a pharmacy technician and work at CVS.

CVS also offers tuition reimbursement and educational assistance programs for its employees, which can help with the cost of pursuing further education in pharmacy.

It's worth noting that, to gain more information and apply, he should check with the specific store/location he might be interested in, as some of these programs and benefits may vary.
