What does the Bible say about wars and rumors of wars in Revelations

**assistant:**

The Bible, in the book of Revelations, says that "nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains." (Matthew 24:7-8) This is referring to the end times and the events leading up to the second coming of Jesus Christ. The "wars and rumors of wars" mentioned in this passage are seen as signs of the end of the world and the approach of the final judgment.

Are the Jewish people still waiting for their Messiah?

**assistant:**

Yes, many Jewish people are still waiting for the arrival of their Messiah. The belief in a future Messiah is a central tenet of Judaism, and has been an important part of Jewish tradition for thousands of years. According to Jewish belief, the Messiah will be a leader who will bring peace, justice, and prosperity to the world, and who will restore the Kingdom of Israel. While some Jews believe that the Messiah has already come, many others continue to wait and hope for his arrival.

Regarding the Jews that believe the Messiah has already come, what do they think regarding now then? Are we in the period of salvation?

The Jews who believe the Messiah has already come may have different views on what this means for the world and the current time. Some may believe that they are already in the period of salvation, and that the Messiah's arrival has begun a new era of peace, justice, and prosperity for the Jewish people and the world.

Others may see the Messiah's arrival as the start of a process that will lead to the eventual arrival of the Messianic era, and view the current period as a time of transition or preparation.

Ultimately, the interpretation of the Messiah's arrival and its implications for the current time can vary among those who believe that the Messiah has already come, and may be influenced by personal beliefs, religious traditions, and cultural context.

Do those that believe the Messiah has already come name a Messiah?

**assistant:**

Yes, Jews who believe the Messiah has already come often name a specific individual as the Messiah. The identification of the Messiah can vary among different Jewish communities and traditions. Some Jews believe that the Messiah has not yet come, while others believe that the Messiah has already come, but has not yet fulfilled all of the Messianic prophecies.

In some cases, Jews who believe the Messiah has already come may name a historical figure, such as a past leader or rabbi, as the Messiah. In other cases, they may identify a contemporary individual as the Messiah. However, there is no consensus among Jews on the identity of the Messiah, and this is a matter of ongoing debate and discussion within the Jewish community.
