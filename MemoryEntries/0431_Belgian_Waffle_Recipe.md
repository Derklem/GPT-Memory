Of course, here's a recipe for classic Belgian waffles that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 3/4 cups milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:

1. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar until well combined.

2. In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.

3. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, whisking until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the waffles tough.

4. Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once it's hot, lightly grease it with non-stick cooking spray.

5. Ladle the batter onto the hot waffle iron and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 3-4 minutes. Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the waffle iron as needed.

6. Serve the waffles warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, whipped cream, syrup, or powdered sugar.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Belgian waffles!
