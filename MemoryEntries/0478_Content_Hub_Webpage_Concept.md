**assistant:**

You are describing a web page that acts as a central hub for external content, with a focus on product recommendations, social movements, and civil and social interaction. Users can create an account, but do not have a personal page. The home page features slide windows with video or external link content, organized by topic, with headlines relevant to the user's initial three question pop-up. Users can store and manage the content they like and interact with, providing them with easy access to previously viewed information and guided recommendations for future content to consume. Is there any specific question you would like me to help with?


**user:**

Does anything like this already exist?

**assistant:**

There are certainly websites that share similarities with the one you described. For example, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter allow users to create an account, interact with and share external content, and receive recommendations based on their interests. News aggregators like Reddit and Flipboard also allow users to curate and interact with external content. Additionally, some platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram allows users to create and share videos, and others like Pinterest and Polyvore are primarily focused on product recommendations and user-generated content. However, it's possible that a website with all the features you described doesn't exist yet or it might exist as a combination of these websites.


**user:**

Could you help me develop this web page? I'm familiar with HTML and CSS and I have some rudimentary Java.

**assistant:**

I'd be happy to help you develop your web page! Here are a few steps you can take to get started:

1. First, you'll need to decide on the specific features you want to include on your web page. This might include things like a login system, a content recommendation system, and a way for users to save and organize content.

2. Next, you'll need to plan out the overall design and layout of your web page. This can include things like the color scheme, the placement of elements, and the overall user experience.

3. Once you have a clear idea of what you want to build, you can start to develop the web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use a framework like Bootstrap to help with the layout and design, and you can use a JavaScript library like jQuery to add interactivity and dynamic functionality.

4. As you develop the web page, you'll also need to consider how to handle user data, such as login information and saved content. You may want to use a database like MySQL to store this data, and a server-side language like PHP or Node.js to interact with the database and handle user requests.

5. Finally, you'll need to test and debug your web page to ensure that everything is working as expected. Once you're satisfied with the final product, you can deploy it to a web server so that it can be accessed by others.

Please note that the above steps are general guidelines, it's a complex process to create a website and it depends on the complexity of the features you want to include. If you're new to web development, it might be helpful to start with a simpler project before tackling something more ambitious.

Also, it's worth noting that creating a website also requires a lot of knowledge about web security and best practices for web development, so you may want to consider seeking help or guidance from experienced developers.


**user:**

I am not familiar with a lot of the security protocols regarding the back end. I'm also not in a position to receive funding. I am however capable of learning and putting time forward. Are there any organizations or institutions you're aware of that might be willing to engage with me based off of this idea and developing this platform?

**assistant:**

Developing a web page or platform can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially if you're not familiar with web security protocols and best practices. It's great that you are willing to put in the time and effort to learn, but creating a website is a complex process and requires a lot of knowledge and expertise to do it right.

If you are not in a position to receive funding and you don't have the resources to hire a professional developer, there are a few options you can consider:

1. Open-source communities: There are many open-source communities, such as GitHub, where developers share and collaborate on code. You can use these communities to find developers who are willing to work on your project, or you can contribute to existing open-source projects that align with your idea.

2. Community resources: Look for community resources such as hackathons, coding bootcamps or coding clubs, where you can learn new skills and network with other developers. Some organizations also offer free or low-cost web development classes or workshops.

3. Online learning platforms: There are many online learning platforms, such as Codecademy, Udemy, or Coursera, where you can learn web development skills at your own pace.

4. Non-profit organizations: Some non-profit organizations focus on providing web development education and resources to under-served communities. They may be willing to help you develop your web page or platform.

It's important to keep in mind that creating a website, especially one that handles user data and has social interaction features, is a complex process and it's essential to know the security protocols and best practices. It's also a good idea to seek guidance from experienced developers to ensure that your website is secure and reliable.

Keep in mind that finding the right resources and organizations to help you develop your web page or platform may take some time and research, but with persistence and a willingness to learn, you can achieve your goal.
