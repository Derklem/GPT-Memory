Which people have the most amount of assets in regards to property and industry not stock

**assistant:**

It's difficult to determine definitively which individuals have the most amount of assets in terms of property and industry, as this information is often private and not publicly disclosed. However, some of the wealthiest individuals and families in the world are known to have significant assets in various industries and real estate holdings. For example:

- Mukesh Ambani, chairman and largest shareholder of Reliance Industries, is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world and is known to have significant assets in various industries, including energy, telecommunications, and retail. He is also reported to have real estate holdings, including a $1 billion residence in Mumbai.

- The Walton family, owners of Walmart, is one of the wealthiest families in the world and has significant assets in the retail industry, as well as real estate holdings.

- The Koch family, known for their ownership and control of Koch Industries, is one of the wealthiest families in the world and has significant assets in various industries, including energy, chemicals, and finance.

Again, it's important to note that this information is often private and estimates of individual wealth and assets can vary.
