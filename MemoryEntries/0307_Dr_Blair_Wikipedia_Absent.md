Why doesn't Dr Delbert Blair have a Wikipedia 

**assistant:**

Dr. Delbert Blair may not have a Wikipedia page for various reasons. It's possible that no one has created a page for him yet, or there may not be enough verifiable information available to meet Wikipedia's notability guidelines. Additionally, Wikipedia's editorial process can be rigorous, and if there have been attempts to create a page that didn't meet their criteria, it might have been deleted.

**assistant:**

Dr. Delbert Blair was known for his lectures on various topics related to spirituality, metaphysics, and holistic health. His talks often delved into esoteric subjects and alternative perspectives on science and consciousness. It's great that you're finding value in his lectures from 1995!

**user:**

I'm just curious as to why I can't find mainstream information about him. As though he has been intentionally scrubbed.

**assistant:**

It's possible that Dr. Delbert Blair's work and teachings didn't receive widespread attention in mainstream sources, which could contribute to the lack of information about him in mainstream channels like Wikipedia. Sometimes, figures within niche or alternative communities may not have as much visibility in broader media. However, he may still be well-known and respected within certain circles or communities that appreciate his contributions.

But there is flatt earth pages.  And pages on insignificant people 

**assistant:**

The reasons for variations in coverage on Wikipedia can be complex and may not always align with the perceived significance of a topic. While some topics or individuals may have extensive coverage, others, despite their contributions or following, might not meet Wikipedia's criteria for notability or have editors willing to create and maintain their pages. It's a dynamic process influenced by community norms, editorial decisions, and the availability of verifiable sources.
