What's the deal regarding the ritual after the Queen of England's death where they snapped the wand

**assistant:**

The ritual you're referring to is part of the ceremonial proceedings following the death of a British monarch. Specifically, it involves the breaking of the Wand of Office, also known as the Lord Chamberlain's Wand.

The Lord Chamberlain is the most senior official of the Royal Household. At the end of the funeral service for the monarch, the Lord Chamberlain ceremonially breaks the Wand of Office and places it on the monarch's coffin before it is lowered into the royal vault. This act symbolizes the end of the Lord Chamberlain's service to the deceased sovereign and the conclusion of their royal duties. It is a significant and symbolic gesture, representing the end of one reign and the transition to the next monarch.

**user:**

Is there a new wand established for the new monarch?

**assistant:**

Yes, after the Wand of Office is broken as part of the funeral rituals for the deceased monarch, a new Wand of Office is created for the new Lord Chamberlain, who will serve the new monarch. The breaking of the wand is a symbolic act signifying the end of service to the previous sovereign, and the establishment of a new wand signifies the commencement of service to the new king or queen. This tradition ensures the continuity of the Lord Chamberlain's role within the Royal Household.

**user:**

What happens to the old Lord of chamberlain? Does he transition to the new monarch or is he eliminated with the old monarch

**assistant:**

The Lord Chamberlain often continues in their role under the new monarch, at least initially. The position of Lord Chamberlain is a royal appointment, and the new monarch has the authority to either retain the current Lord Chamberlain or appoint a new one. While the breaking of the Wand of Office is a symbolic gesture marking the end of their service to the deceased monarch, it does not necessarily mean the immediate end of their tenure. 

In practice, the continuation or replacement of the Lord Chamberlain depends on the preferences and decisions of the new monarch. It is not uncommon for the new monarch to keep the existing Lord Chamberlain for a period of transition to ensure continuity and stability within the Royal Household.
