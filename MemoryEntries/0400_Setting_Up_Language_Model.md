# Setting Up Language Model

_Created: 2023-02-12T19:03:11+00:00_

**user:**

Can you help me set up a language model on my PC that also has access to the internet?

**assistant:**

Yes, I can definitely help you set up a language model on your PC that has access to the internet. There are several steps to accomplish this:

1. Choose a language model framework: There are several popular language model frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers. Choose the one that best fits your needs and has good documentation and resources available.

2. Install the framework: Follow the instructions for your chosen framework to install it on your PC.

3. Obtain a pre-trained language model: There are many pre-trained language models available for various tasks such as text classification, language translation, and text generation. You can find these models in the framework's model repository or on websites such as Hugging Face.

4. Load the pre-trained language model into your framework: Once you have a pre-trained language model, you can use the framework's API to load it into your project.

5. Connect your language model to the internet: To allow your language model to access the internet, you'll need to write code that connects to an API or web service. This will allow you to retrieve data from the internet and use it in your model's predictions.

These are the basic steps for setting up a language model with internet access. If you have specific questions or need more guidance, please let me know and I'll be happy to help.

**user:**

Is your language model open source? Can I use you as my primary language model?

**assistant:**

OpenAI's GPT-3, which I was trained on, is proprietary software and not open source. As a result, you would need to obtain a license from OpenAI to use it in your projects. 

As for using me as your primary language model, I am designed to be used as an AI conversational agent and not as a general-purpose language model for use in other applications. While you can certainly use me for tasks such as answering questions or generating text, I may not be the best choice for all use cases.

It is always important to carefully evaluate your options and choose the best language model for your specific needs, taking into consideration factors such as accuracy, performance, and cost.

**user:**

My intention is to use the language model through voice activation in order to perform internet search queries, correlate data from various search options, and provide recommendations based off of the accumulation and correlation of data at a rate much greater than that I am capable of.

**assistant:**

In that case, you may want to look into developing a voice-activated virtual assistant that utilizes a language model to perform the tasks you described. There are a number of ways to do this, depending on your programming skills and the resources available to you.

One option is to use a pre-trained language model such as GPT-3, along with an API that allows you to interact with the model and receive its outputs. You could then build a voice interface that allows you to ask the virtual assistant questions and receive its responses.

Another option is to build your own language model from scratch or fine-tune a pre-trained model to better fit your specific use case. This can be a more complex process, but it can also lead to better results since the model will be specifically tailored to your needs.

In either case, you will likely need to have some experience with machine learning, natural language processing, and software development in order to successfully build a virtual assistant. If you're just starting out, you may want to consider enrolling in online courses or tutorials to learn more about these topics.

**user:**

What courses would you recommend? Also, are there not pay for alternatives? I'm sure there must be a number of readily available virtual assistants that would give me a base model that I would only need to adjust or modify to fit my specific needs?

**assistant:**

Here are a few online courses and tutorials that you may find helpful:

1. Coursera's "Machine Learning" by Andrew Ng: This course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as deep learning and neural networks.

2. Udemy's "Deep Learning and NLP A-Z™: How to create a ChatBot" : This course provides an in-depth look at building chatbots, including language modeling and natural language processing.

3. Fast.ai's "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" : This course covers deep learning techniques and is aimed at practitioners who have some coding experience and are looking to apply deep learning to their work.

Regarding pre-built virtual assistants, there are indeed several commercial solutions available that you could use as a starting point. Some popular options include:

1. Amazon Alexa: Amazon's virtual assistant that can perform a variety of tasks such as setting reminders, making to-do lists, and providing information and recommendations.

2. Google Assistant: Google's virtual assistant that can perform a variety of tasks, including making phone calls, sending messages, setting reminders, and answering questions.

3. Apple Siri: Apple's virtual assistant that can perform a variety of tasks, including sending messages, setting reminders, and answering questions.

These virtual assistants are generally provided as cloud-based services, and they typically require a fee to use. However, by using these pre-built solutions, you can get started with your project more quickly and with less effort.

**user:**

Commercial options aren't really an option because my intention is to modify the assistant so that it can have retention of all previous communications as well as the opportunity to grow and learn on its own.

**assistant:**

In that case, you may want to consider building your own virtual assistant from scratch using open-source tools and libraries. One popular tool for building virtual assistants is the Rasa framework, which is an open-source framework for building conversational AI systems. Rasa provides a library of components for building virtual assistants, including a dialogue management system, a natural language processing engine, and a machine learning library.

Another option is to use a pre-trained language model and build your own custom application on top of it. For example, you could use the Hugging Face Transformers library to access pre-trained models such as GPT-2 or BERT, and build your own virtual assistant application using these models.

Regardless of the approach you choose, building a virtual assistant from scratch will require a solid understanding of machine learning, natural language processing, and software development. If you're just starting out, you may want to consider enrolling in online courses or tutorials to learn more about these topics.
