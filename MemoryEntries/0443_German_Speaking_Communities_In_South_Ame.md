How many communities are there in South America that speak German only

**assistant:**

I am not aware of any communities in South America that speak German as their only language. While there are communities in South America with German heritage, such as the Mennonites in Paraguay, they primarily speak Spanish or Portuguese, as well as dialects of German such as Plautdietsch.
