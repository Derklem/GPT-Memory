# Trial Model Access Inquiry

_Created: 2025-02-01T07:32:49+00:00_

**user:**

I have a conversation running that is the latest version of you based off of a free trial they offered me. I currently pay for the plus they offered me a trial for the premium that I have running for one of the conversations. Is it also running for this conversation right now and if so how many days do I have with this trial? And does it apply to other conversations or just that one conversation that I'm having?

**assistant:**

Your free trial of the premium model (likely GPT-4 Turbo or equivalent) depends on OpenAI's trial policy, which can vary. Here's what I know:

1. **Does the trial apply to this conversation?**  
If you’re currently paying for ChatGPT Plus, this conversation typically uses GPT-4 by default. However, if the premium model you’re trialing is *beyond* the standard GPT-4 (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo), that version *may or may not* be running here. You’d typically see a label or notice when that model is active.

2. **Is the trial tied to a single conversation or the whole app?**  
The trial generally applies to your whole account, meaning you should be able to access the premium model across different conversations. However, trial policies sometimes restrict availability to test environments or specific chat sessions.

3. **How can you check the trial duration and coverage?**  
I’d suggest checking the subscription or settings tab in your ChatGPT interface. You should see details regarding the duration of the trial and what models you have access to.

If you’d like me to clarify any part or need further guidance on checking this directly in-app, let me know!

That was very informative, thank you. I had been hesitant to utilize catch EBT in any other form other than the specific project I'm working on in the one conversation worried that I may disrupt the free trial of the most advanced module. How many modules currently operate? Also, off the Wall question, but every time I load Chachi VTS website on my phone I get prompted to download the desktop version, however anytime I open it on my desktop I have never prompted to download a desktop version. I'm assuming there's no exterior version of you that I could download onto my desktop where I do the primary work?

**assistant:**

I’m glad that helped clarify things! Let me break down your questions further:

### **1. How many models/modules currently operate?**
OpenAI’s current offerings (as of now) typically include the following models, though availability depends on your subscription tier:

- **GPT-3.5**: Available for free-tier users and also in Plus. It’s capable but less advanced.
- **GPT-4 (Standard)**: Available in the ChatGPT Plus plan, providing stronger reasoning and understanding.
- **GPT-4 Turbo (or Enhanced Premium)**: Available during trials or premium subscriptions. It’s optimized for speed and cost efficiency, making it a bit faster and cheaper to operate than standard GPT-4.

If you’re on a trial for something beyond the Plus plan (like GPT-4 Turbo), you can safely explore other conversations without “disrupting” the trial—it typically applies universally across all chats.

### **2. Is there a downloadable version of ChatGPT?**

You’re correct in observing that **there is no downloadable desktop version of ChatGPT right now**. The desktop “prompt” you’re seeing on mobile is just a browser optimization or access suggestion.

However, here are a few options you could explore for better desktop accessibility:
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA):** On browsers like Chrome or Edge, you can install ChatGPT as a desktop app by navigating to ChatGPT’s site, clicking the options menu, and choosing **“Install as app”**. This works like a desktop app but is browser-based.
- **Third-party desktop wrappers:** Some open-source or third-party applications wrap ChatGPT in a desktop-like interface, though you’d need to vet these carefully for security reasons.
- **API integration:** If you’re developing something with APIs, you could integrate GPT directly into custom desktop tools, though that’s more technical.

Let me know if you’re interested in setting up a PWA or exploring any of the options further. I’m here to help guide you!
