What would be a healthy treat to sneak into an elephant

**assistant:**

Elephants are herbivores and their diet consists mainly of grasses, leaves, bark, and twigs. Some healthy treat options for elephants include:

1. Fresh fruits: Elephants love fruits such as watermelons, apples, and bananas.

2. Vegetables: Carrots, celery, and other crunchy vegetables are also a good option.

3. Hay or dried grass: These can be given as a snack or mixed into their regular diet as roughage.

4. Browse: Browse refers to young trees and shrubs that elephants can nibble on.

It's important to note that while these treats may be healthy for elephants, they should not make up a significant portion of their diet. Elephants have specialized digestive systems and require a specific balance of nutrients, so it's best to consult with a veterinarian or animal nutritionist before making any changes to their diet.
