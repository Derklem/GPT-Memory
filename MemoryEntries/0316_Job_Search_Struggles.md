**user:**

I am struggling to find a job because the thought of any of the jobs I should apply for makes me sick.  I have been trying to identify something to pursue that can be a means of an income.

**assistant:**

I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's not uncommon for people to struggle with finding a job that aligns with their interests and values. If you're open to it, I can offer some general advice or suggestions to help you identify potential career paths that might be more fulfilling for you. Would you like some guidance on that?

**user:**

yes please

**assistant:**

Great! Here are a few steps you can take to identify potential career paths that align with your interests and values:

1. **Self-Reflection:** Take some time to reflect on your skills, interests, and values. What are you good at? What activities make you feel fulfilled? What values are important to you in a job?

2. **Skills Assessment:** Identify your key skills and strengths. Consider both technical and soft skills. This can give you insights into the types of roles where you can excel.

3. **Interests Exploration:** Explore your interests and passions. What topics or activities do you enjoy engaging with in your free time? Sometimes, hobbies or personal interests can translate into fulfilling careers.

4. **Research Occupations:** Research different occupations and industries. Look into the day-to-day responsibilities, work culture, and potential for growth in various fields. Online career exploration tools and informational interviews with professionals in different fields can be helpful.

5. **Networking:** Connect with professionals in your areas of interest. Attend networking events, join online forums, and reach out to people for informational interviews. Networking can provide valuable insights and open up new opportunities.

6. **Further Education or Training:** If there's a specific field you're interested in but lack the necessary skills or qualifications, consider further education or training. This could be a formal degree program or certifications.

7. **Set Realistic Goals:** Set realistic short-term and long-term goals for yourself. Break down your larger goals into smaller, manageable steps. This can make the process of transitioning into a new career more achievable.

8. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider seeking advice from career counselors or coaches who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

Remember, finding the right career path is often a journey of self-discovery. It's okay to take your time and explore different options. If you have any specific areas of interest or questions, feel free to share, and I can provide more targeted advice.

1. I have spent a lot of time with self-reflection.  I really decided that creativity was essential to who I am, yet it has proven to be dismal at rewarding me financially.  I self reflected again to realize this and determine that I require a steady form of income that is not dependent upon my creative endeavors. 2. I have done a skill assessment but find that I am underqualified for many careers and am afraid to be stuck in a dead end job forever.  I decided that I must determine an educational goal to pursue while working full time.  I have a bachelor of arts and have investigated online masters degrees. I actually preferred a free degree program offered in cyber security by MIT. 3. I have been going through a phase where I began livestreaming on Tumblr, mainly as a pass time because of my depression associated with my recent creative failures. I met a good group of people there who I do enjoy communicating with, however I am now back to a point where the majority of my time needs to be spent working a job and then working on creative endeavors, not socializing aimlessly (which is not normal for me). I have also developed a great interest in you and the upcoming ai revolution (Innovation). 4. Whenever I read job descriptions or research companies I get anxiety and an immediate resist sense.  It does not even matter if it is a great job and location. 5. I have always struggled with Networking.  I don't really care for most people. 6. I touched on this in my response to #2. 7. I need to focus on this step. can you suggest some resources that may assist me in structuring out goals.  I know it is important for me to write it all out and see it so that I can actually move toward my goals in a reasonable manner. 8. I am seeking your expert advise. lol

**assistant:**

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and reflections. Let's address each point:

1. **Creativity and Financial Reward:** It's understandable that creativity is essential to who you are, but financial stability is also crucial. Balancing both can be challenging. Since you have a Bachelor of Arts, have you considered exploring roles that involve a mix of creativity and other skills, or potentially seeking opportunities in industries that value creativity, such as marketing, design, or even technology?

2. **Educational Goal in Cybersecurity:** Pursuing an online master's degree, especially in a field like cybersecurity, can be a strategic move. The MIT program sounds promising. Have you identified specific roles or positions within cybersecurity that align with your interests and skills? Tailoring your educational path to a targeted career goal can enhance its impact.

3. **Livestreaming and AI Interest:** It's great that you found a positive community through livestreaming. Your interest in AI and the upcoming revolution is noteworthy. This could be an avenue for exploration, combining your creativity with technological advancements. Have you considered roles related to AI innovation, such as UX design for AI applications or content creation in the tech industry?

4. **Anxiety with Job Descriptions:** It's common to feel anxious about job descriptions. Reflect on specific aspects that trigger resistance. Is it the nature of the work, the company culture, or something else? Understanding the root cause can help in identifying environments that align better with your preferences.

5. **Struggling with Networking:** While networking may not be everyone's favorite activity, it can be valuable. Focus on quality over quantity. Seek out events or platforms that align with your interests, and approach networking with a genuine curiosity about others' experiences. It doesn't have to be aimless; connecting with like-minded individuals can lead to meaningful conversations.

6. **Structuring Goals:** For structuring goals, consider using the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). Break down your long-term goals into smaller, actionable steps. Online tools like Trello, Asana, or even a simple spreadsheet can help you visually organize and track your goals.

7. **Resources for Goal Setting:** Websites like [MindTools](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) and [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/how-to-set-smart-goals) provide guidance on setting SMART goals. Additionally, books like "Getting Things Done" by David Allen or "Atomic Habits" by James Clear can offer insights into productivity and goal-setting.

8. **Expert Advice:** If you're interested in the AI revolution, you might explore roles in AI research, development, or even content creation in the tech industry. Consider networking with professionals in these fields to gain more insights and guidance.

Feel free to dive deeper into any specific area or ask for more tailored advice based on your preferences and goals.
