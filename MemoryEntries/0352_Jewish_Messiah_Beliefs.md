Jews believe that the coming of the Messiah, also known as the Moshiach in Hebrew, will be a future event that will herald a new era of peace, justice, and knowledge. According to Jewish tradition, the Messiah will be a human being, a descendant of King David, who will bring about the ultimate redemption of the Jewish people and the world.

Jews have different beliefs about the specific identity of the Messiah. Some Jews believe that the Messiah has not yet arrived, while others believe that the Messiah will be a great leader who will arise in a time of great need. There are also different interpretations of what the Messiah's mission will entail.

However, it's important to note that the concept of the Messiah is a complex and multifaceted one, and not all Jews have the same beliefs or expectations regarding the coming of the Messiah.
