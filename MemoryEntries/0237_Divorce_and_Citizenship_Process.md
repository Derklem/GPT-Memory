If my wife sponsored me to the us (under I-130), I have a green card now, have been in the US for two years, how does my wife divorcing me affect my ability to become a citizen?

Your ability to become a U.S. citizen depends on your eligibility to apply for naturalization based on your current circumstances. Here are the key factors to consider:

### 1. **Divorce Impact on Naturalization Timeline**
   - **Spouse-Sponsored (3-Year Rule):** Normally, if you're married to a U.S. citizen and living with them, you can apply for naturalization after 3 years of having a green card.
   - **Divorce Changes This Timeline:** If your wife divorces you, you are no longer eligible for the 3-year rule. Instead, you must follow the standard 5-year rule, meaning you can apply for citizenship 5 years after becoming a lawful permanent resident.

### 2. **Conditional Green Card Issues**
   - If your green card was conditional (valid for 2 years), you must file Form I-751 to remove conditions before it expires. Normally, this is done jointly with your spouse, but after a divorce, you must request a **waiver** of the joint filing requirement and prove:
     - The marriage was entered in good faith (not for immigration purposes).
     - The divorce or annulment is finalized.

   - Evidence of a bona fide marriage (e.g., joint finances, shared property, photos, and affidavits) will be crucial.

### 3. **General Naturalization Eligibility**
   - Regardless of your divorce, you must meet the standard eligibility requirements, including:
     - Continuous residence and physical presence in the U.S.
     - Good moral character (e.g., no significant criminal history).
     - Passing the English and civics tests.
     - Complying with U.S. immigration laws.

### 4. **Divorce and Good Moral Character**
   - Divorce itself does not negatively impact your moral character evaluation. However, issues such as failure to pay alimony or child support, if required, can raise concerns during your naturalization process.

### 5. **Next Steps**
   - **If Your Green Card is Conditional:** File Form I-751 with a waiver as soon as possible if you haven’t already done so.
   - **If Your Green Card is Permanent (10-Year):** Continue to maintain your status and track your eligibility under the 5-year rule.
   - **Seek Legal Advice:** Consider consulting an immigration attorney to ensure all documents and evidence meet the requirements.
