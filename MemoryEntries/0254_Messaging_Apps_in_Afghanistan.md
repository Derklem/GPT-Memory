My girlfriend went to Afghanistan. She told me what's up does not work there anymore. What apps work there so I can reach out to her

I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble reaching your girlfriend in Afghanistan. WhatsApp has faced intermittent bans in the country due to government directives and actions by its parent company, Meta, which have disrupted its availability. citeturn0search9

Given these challenges, you might consider alternative communication methods:

- **Signal**: A secure messaging app known for its strong encryption and privacy features. It's widely used and could be a viable option if accessible in Afghanistan.

- **Threema**: A privacy-focused messaging app that doesn't require a phone number or email to register, enhancing user anonymity. Its availability in Afghanistan would need to be confirmed.

- **Wickr Me**: An encrypted messaging app offering features like self-destructing messages and file sharing. Its accessibility in Afghanistan should be verified.

- **SimpleX Chat**: A private and encrypted messenger without user IDs, aiming to provide enhanced privacy. citeturn0search6 Its usability in Afghanistan would need to be checked.

Additionally, traditional SMS services remain an option, though they lack the encryption and features of modern messaging apps. It's important to note that the Afghan government has previously ordered temporary bans on messaging services like WhatsApp and Telegram, citing technical problems and security concerns. citeturn0search11

Before adopting any of these alternatives, it's advisable to:

1. **Verify Accessibility**: Ensure the app is functional in Afghanistan, as some services may be restricted or face connectivity issues.

2. **Check Security Features**: Confirm that the app provides the level of security and privacy you desire for your communications.

3. **Coordinate with Your Girlfriend**: Discuss and agree on the platform to use, ensuring both of you can install and access it without difficulties.

Keep in mind that internet infrastructure and government policies in Afghanistan can affect the reliability and accessibility of these services. Staying informed about the current digital communication landscape in the region will help you maintain contact with your girlfriend.
