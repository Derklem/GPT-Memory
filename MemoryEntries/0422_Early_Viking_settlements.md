What are our earliest Viking settlements

**assistant:**



The Vikings were a seafaring people who originated from modern-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. They are known for their raids and exploration throughout Europe and beyond during the Viking Age, which lasted from the late 8th century to the mid-11th century.

Some of the earliest Viking settlements were established in the late 8th century in what is now Norway. These settlements were small and typically consisted of a few houses or farms. One of the earliest known Viking settlements in Norway is located at Oseberg, where an impressive Viking ship burial was discovered in 1903.

In Denmark, the earliest Viking settlements date back to the 8th century and are located in areas such as Hedeby, Ribe, and Aarhus. These settlements were important trading centers and played a significant role in the development of Viking culture.

In Sweden, the earliest Viking settlements were established in the 9th century. One of the most important Viking sites in Sweden is Birka, which was a major trading center located on the island of Björkö in Lake Mälaren. Birka was founded in the mid-8th century and became an important hub for trade between the Baltic and the North Sea.

Overall, the Viking settlements varied in size and purpose, but they all played an important role in the development of Viking society and culture.

I'm actually more interested in the early peoples of that region. Prior to any moniker that may have distinguished a period. Actually could you please lay out the periods of settlements and peoples for Northern Europe from their earliest till current

**assistant:**

Certainly! The history of settlement in Northern Europe is complex and spans many thousands of years. Here is a brief overview of the major periods and peoples of the region:

1. Prehistoric Era (before 500 BCE): During this time, Northern Europe was inhabited by various indigenous cultures, including the Mesolithic Komsa culture, the Neolithic Funnelbeaker culture, and the Bronze Age Nordic Bronze Age culture. These early peoples lived as hunter-gatherers, herders, and farmers.

2. Iron Age (500 BCE - 800 CE): The Iron Age saw the emergence of several distinct cultures in Northern Europe, including the La Tène culture in present-day Switzerland and Central Europe, and the Jastorf culture in northern Germany and Denmark. In Scandinavia, the Iron Age is characterized by the development of the Nordic Iron Age culture, which included the production of distinctive art and runic inscriptions.

3. Viking Age (800 - 1050 CE): The Viking Age is perhaps the most well-known period of Northern European history, characterized by the seafaring exploits and raids of the Vikings. During this time, the Vikings established settlements throughout Northern Europe and beyond, including in modern-day England, Ireland, Russia, and Iceland.

4. Middle Ages (1050 - 1500 CE): The Middle Ages saw the rise of powerful kingdoms and empires in Northern Europe, including the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Denmark, and the Kingdom of Sweden. The region was also influenced by the spread of Christianity, which led to the construction of numerous churches and monasteries.

5. Early Modern Period (1500 - 1800 CE): The early modern period saw significant political and cultural changes in Northern Europe. The Protestant Reformation led to the establishment of new churches and religious movements, while the rise of powerful states like Sweden and Denmark-Norway led to increased conflict and competition.

6. Industrial Revolution (1800s CE): The industrial revolution transformed Northern Europe, leading to the growth of urban centers and the development of new industries like manufacturing and textiles.

7. Modern Era (20th century to present): In the modern era, Northern Europe has become known for its advanced economies, social welfare systems, and high standards of living. The region is home to some of the world's most prosperous and socially progressive nations, including Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.

So the earliest artifacts we have from the region that to pick any type of settlement or tool usage is from 500 BCE?

**assistant:**

No, the earliest evidence of human settlement in Northern Europe dates back to the Mesolithic period, which began around 10,000 BCE and lasted until about 4,000 BCE. During this time, people in Northern Europe lived as hunter-gatherers and developed various types of stone tools and weapons, such as flint knives and axes.

Archaeological evidence from this period has been found in various parts of Northern Europe, including Scandinavia, the British Isles, and the Baltic region. For example, the Kongemose culture of Denmark and the Kunda culture of Estonia are both considered to be representative of the Mesolithic period in Northern Europe.

The Neolithic period, which began around 4,000 BCE and lasted until about 2,500 BCE, saw the emergence of agriculture and the development of settled communities in Northern Europe. During this time, people began to farm the land and build more permanent dwellings, such as longhouses and megalithic tombs.

So, to answer your question, the earliest artifacts from Northern Europe that indicate settlement and tool usage date back to the Mesolithic period, which began around 10,000 BCE.

I know I was asking about Northern Europe but now I feel compelled to reference the cave paintings in France that were found to be over 40,000 years old. That coupled with the discoveries in Turkey with Gobekli tepe , as well as the recent discovery of the red-haired mummy in China, all lead me to believe that there are perhaps significant archaeological discoveries still available in the Northern European area that could push those dates back considerably farther. These kinds of considerations must be made for all areas. I mainly ask because I was considering legend, myth, and scientific fact regarding humans and their different appearance in language.

**assistant:**

You are correct that there is evidence of human activity in Europe and other parts of the world dating back much further than the periods I mentioned earlier. The cave paintings in France, for example, are among the oldest known examples of prehistoric art, and they provide valuable insights into the beliefs and practices of early humans.

Similarly, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey is an important archaeological site that dates back to the Neolithic period, around 10,000 BCE, and is believed to be one of the earliest examples of human architecture. The discovery of the red-haired mummy in China is also significant, as it provides evidence of the diversity of human populations in the past.

In Northern Europe, there have been significant archaeological discoveries in recent years that have pushed back the timeline of human settlement and activity. For example, the discovery of the Kongemose culture in Denmark, which I mentioned earlier, has been dated to around 6,000 BCE, which is earlier than previously thought.

It's certainly possible that further discoveries could push the timeline back even further, and there is always more to learn about the history of human civilization. However, it's important to approach such discoveries with a critical eye and rely on the best available scientific evidence, rather than myths or legends, when making claims about the past.

How frequently do you update your information?

**assistant:**

As an AI language model, I am continuously updating my knowledge base and learning from various sources on the internet. However, my training data cutoff is from September 2021, and any information that has been published or discovered after that time may not be included in my current knowledge base. 

My responses are generated based on the best available information I have at the time of answering, but it's important to keep in mind that new research and discoveries can constantly update our understanding of various topics.
