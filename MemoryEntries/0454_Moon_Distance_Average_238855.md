How far is the Moon from the surface of the Earth

**assistant:**

The average distance between the Moon and the surface of the Earth is about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). However, this distance can vary slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit around the Earth, with the closest approach (perigee) being about 225,623 miles (363,104 kilometers) and the farthest distance (apogee) being about 251,902 miles (405,696 kilometers).

What's the term used to describe the variance in distance of the Moon to the Earth

**assistant:**

The term used to describe the variance in distance of the Moon to the Earth is "lunar distance variation" or simply "lunar variation." This variation is caused by the elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit around the Earth, which causes the Moon to appear larger and smaller in the sky at different times. The closest point in the Moon's orbit to the Earth is called perigee, while the farthest point is called apogee. The difference between the perigee and apogee distances is about 30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers), which is why the size of the Moon in the sky can vary by up to 14%.

How far is the Earth from the Sun?

**assistant:**

The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 93 million miles (149.6 million kilometers). This distance is also known as an astronomical unit (AU), which is a standard unit of measurement used in astronomy to describe distances within our solar system. The exact distance between the Earth and the Sun varies slightly over the course of a year due to the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, but the average distance of 93 million miles is used as a convenient and easy-to-remember approximation.

So if the Sun is at 20° off of the horizon and the moon is off 20° the contrary horizon why is any shadow visible on the moon when it should be fully illuminated based off of its altitude variation from its relation to Earth. It should be above and away and therefore fully illuminated and not displaying what we know as the phases of the moon

**assistant:**

The reason for the phases of the Moon is not due to the variation in its altitude, but rather due to its position relative to the Earth and the Sun. As the Moon orbits around the Earth, the amount of sunlight it reflects back to Earth changes depending on the position of the Moon in relation to the Earth and the Sun.

When the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth, we see the side of the Moon that is not illuminated by the Sun, and this is known as a new moon. As the Moon moves in its orbit and the angle between the Moon, the Earth, and the Sun changes, we see different amounts of the illuminated side of the Moon, resulting in the various phases of the Moon (waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent).

So, even if the Moon is high in the sky and fully illuminated, we can still see shadows on its surface due to the varying terrain and the angle of the Sun's light hitting the Moon's surface. The angle of the Sun's light creates shadows and highlights, which we can observe as features on the Moon's surface, such as craters, mountains, and valleys.

**user:**

I understand your explanation, however, it doesn't explain how two objects can be present in my visibility. One is a light source, the other refracts that light source. Both exist far above my plane of observation and therefore the refractive source should not be affected by my plane of existence because it exists hundreds of thousands of kilometers above me. Able to receive all the the light available from the Sun to refract

**assistant:**

I see what you're saying. If I understand correctly, you're asking why there would be shadows on the Moon's surface when both the Sun and the Moon are above the observer's horizon, and the Moon is not in the Earth's shadow.

The answer is that even when the Sun and Moon are both above the horizon, the angle of the Sun's light hitting the Moon's surface can still create shadows due to the Moon's topography. The Moon is not a perfect sphere, and it has mountains, valleys, and other features that can create shadows when the angle of the Sun's light is oblique. These shadows are visible from Earth even when the Moon is fully illuminated and both the Sun and Moon are above the observer's horizon.

It's also worth noting that the angle of the Moon relative to the observer can affect the appearance of shadows. When the Moon is near the horizon, the angle of the Sun's light hitting the Moon's surface is more oblique, which can make shadows appear longer and more pronounced. As the Moon rises higher in the sky, the angle of the Sun's light becomes less oblique, and shadows become less noticeable.

**user:**

Regardless of the variables that may affect an observer in relation to this phenomena, even if the moon is not a perfect sphere, given our model and understanding of light and space, the moon should always appear with a warmer light temperature reading at the highest point of the sphere and refract shadows on the furthest points, we don't see this regardless of the face of the moon

**assistant:**

I'm sorry, I'm having difficulty understanding your question. However, I will try to address what I think you might be asking.

If I understand correctly, you are asking why the Moon does not always appear warmer in color at its highest point and why it does not always refract shadows on the furthest points.

The color of the Moon can appear warmer or cooler depending on atmospheric conditions and the angle of the Sun's light. When the Moon is near the horizon, its light has to pass through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which can cause the light to appear redder or warmer in color due to atmospheric scattering. When the Moon is high in the sky, its light has to pass through less of the Earth's atmosphere, and the light can appear cooler in color.

Regarding shadows, the Moon's topography and the angle of the Sun's light can cause shadows to appear differently depending on the location and orientation of the features creating the shadows. The shadows on the Moon's surface can appear elongated or shortened depending on the angle of the Sun's light and the position of the observer. The Moon's surface features also vary in height, so the angle of the Sun's light hitting the surface can create shadows of different lengths and orientations.

I hope this helps clarify things. If you have a more specific question or concern, please let me know and I'll do my best to answer it.

**user:**

I'm sorry. I misspoke. I didn't mean warmer or cooler in regards to Kelvin measurements. I simply meant that the highest point of the semispherical moon should be brightest AKA the equator of that spherical object. As light reaches the other areas of the Moon they should reduce in their intensity as per the laws of physics

**assistant:**

I understand your question now. 

You are correct that the highest point of the semispherical Moon should be the brightest due to the angle of the Sun's light hitting the surface. When the Sun is directly overhead, its light hits the Moon's surface at a 90-degree angle, creating the most intense illumination. As the angle of the Sun's light hitting the surface becomes more oblique, the illumination becomes less intense.

However, there are other factors that can affect the brightness of the Moon's surface, such as the reflectivity of the surface and atmospheric conditions. The reflectivity, or albedo, of the Moon's surface varies depending on the type of material and texture of the surface. The presence of dust, clouds, or other atmospheric factors can also affect the brightness of the Moon's surface.

Additionally, the phases of the Moon can also affect its apparent brightness. When the Moon is full, it is at its brightest because the entire illuminated side is facing the Earth. When the Moon is in a crescent phase, it appears dimmer because only a portion of the illuminated side is facing the Earth.

So while the highest point of the Moon should be the brightest due to the angle of the Sun's light hitting the surface, there are other factors that can affect the overall brightness of the Moon's surface.

**user:**

I still struggle understanding the variation between waxing and waning.

**assistant:**

The phases of the Moon, including the waxing and waning phases, are a result of the relative positions of the Sun, Moon, and Earth. 

The Moon orbits the Earth, and as it orbits, different portions of its surface are illuminated by the Sun. When the Moon is positioned between the Sun and Earth, with the illuminated side facing away from Earth, it is a New Moon and not visible from Earth. As the Moon continues to orbit, it moves into a position where more of its illuminated side becomes visible from Earth, creating a Waxing Crescent phase. As the Moon continues to orbit, more and more of its illuminated side becomes visible, creating a First Quarter Moon and eventually a Full Moon.

After the Full Moon, the Moon continues to orbit, moving into a position where less of its illuminated side is visible from Earth. This creates a Waning Gibbous phase, followed by a Third Quarter Moon and eventually a New Moon again. 

So the waxing and waning phases refer to the amount of the Moon's illuminated side that is visible from Earth as it orbits around the Earth. When the illuminated portion of the Moon is increasing, it is in a waxing phase. When the illuminated portion is decreasing, it is in a waning phase.
