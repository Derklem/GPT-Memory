**user:**

I have a Canon mx922 that has failed to operate and I'm interested in acquiring a new printer. What is the best printer for the best price right now?

**assistant:**

The best printer for you depends on your specific needs. If you're looking for a versatile all-in-one printer like the Canon MX922, the Epson EcoTank ET-2760 or the HP OfficeJet Pro 9015 are excellent options known for their reliability and cost-effectiveness in the long run due to their refillable ink tanks. If you prefer a laser printer, the Brother HL-L2350DW or the HP LaserJet Pro M15w are great choices for black and white printing. Consider factors like printing volume, color vs. black and white, and connectivity options when making your decision.

**user:**

The Epson 2760 is not available, is the 2800 model as good?

**assistant:**

Yes, the Epson EcoTank ET-2800 is a newer model and is generally considered an upgrade from the ET-2760. It offers similar features such as refillable ink tanks, wireless printing, and scanning capabilities. The ET-2800 might have some improvements over the ET-2760, such as faster printing speeds or enhanced connectivity options, so it could be a good choice if it fits your budget and meets your printing needs.

How does that compare to the brother ink vestment tank A10

**assistant:**

Both the Epson EcoTank ET-2800 and the Brother INKvestment Tank A10 are excellent choices for users looking for cost-effective printing solutions with refillable ink tanks.

The Epson EcoTank ET-2800 typically offers slightly better color print quality and may have a slightly higher initial purchase price. However, Epson printers are known for their reliability and efficiency, and the EcoTank system allows for easy and mess-free ink refills.

On the other hand, the Brother INKvestment Tank A10 series is known for its fast print speeds, particularly for black and white documents, and may have a lower initial purchase price compared to Epson models. Brother printers are also generally easy to set up and use.

Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on your specific preferences regarding print quality, speed, initial cost, and brand preference. Both models offer cost-effective printing solutions compared to traditional inkjet printers with cartridges.
