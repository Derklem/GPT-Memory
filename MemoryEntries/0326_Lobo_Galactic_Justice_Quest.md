Can you write me a film treatment for a movie?  It will be the first movie in a saga for an existing DC superhero named Lobos.  It should be based on the original comics only deviating for cinematic impact.

Title: Lobo: The Last Czarnian

Genre: Action/Sci-Fi

Logline:
In a distant corner of the galaxy, Lobo, the last survivor of the Czarnian race, finds himself entangled in a cosmic conspiracy that threatens the balance of power among alien civilizations. As he embarks on a brutal and chaotic quest for justice, Lobo discovers the true meaning of heroism and the legacy of his long-extinct people.

Synopsis:
Act 1:
The movie opens with a cosmic event that draws the attention of powerful beings across the universe. As they vie for control over a mysterious artifact known as the Zarnium Heart, the balance of power among alien races is at stake. Unbeknownst to them, the last Czarnian, Lobo, is quietly living on the outskirts of the galaxy, taking mercenary jobs to survive.

Lobo's existence is disrupted when he witnesses the brutal murder of a fellow bounty hunter. Investigating the crime, he discovers a link between the killing and the Zarnium Heart. As he delves deeper into the mystery, Lobo crosses paths with other beings seeking the artifact's power, including the manipulative intergalactic crime lord Kanjar Ro and the enigmatic collector, Lady Styx.

Act 2:
Lobo's quest for justice leads him to gather a motley crew of allies, each with their own reasons for seeking the Zarnium Heart. Among them are a disgraced Green Lantern seeking redemption, a rogue Thanagarian warrior with a vendetta, and a sentient alien weapon named Dawg. Together, they form an unlikely alliance against the forces that threaten the galaxy.

As the group faces increasingly dangerous challenges, Lobo's brutal and unorthodox methods clash with the ideals of his newfound allies. Tensions rise within the team as they navigate treacherous worlds and face formidable adversaries, including the relentless bounty hunter, Slazlo the Inescapable, hired by Kanjar Ro to retrieve the artifact.

Act 3:
The climax unfolds on a distant planet where the Zarnium Heart is revealed to be a source of unimaginable power, capable of reshaping reality itself. Lobo and his team confront Kanjar Ro and Lady Styx in an epic battle that tests the limits of their strength and resolve.

In a shocking twist, Lobo learns the true nature of the Zarnium Heart and its connection to the fate of the Czarnian race. He must make a choice that goes against his self-serving nature, embracing the legacy of his people to save the galaxy from impending destruction.

Epilogue:
As the cosmic dust settles, Lobo reflects on the sacrifices made during the quest. While the artifact is secured, the consequences of its power linger, leaving the galaxy forever changed. Lobo, now aware of his role as the last of the Czarnians, sets off on a new mission to preserve the balance of the cosmos, setting the stage for future adventures in the Lobo saga.
