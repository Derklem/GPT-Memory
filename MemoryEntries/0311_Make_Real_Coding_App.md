**user:**

are you familiar with an application called make real that takes a drawing of an application and codes it?

**assistant:**

I'm familiar with the concept of code generation from visual representations, but I don't have specific information about an application called "make real." It sounds like a tool that could simplify the coding process. How does it work?

**user:**

Can you suggest some applications that can create code from visual representations

**assistant:**

Sure thing! There are several tools that can help generate code from visual representations. Some popular ones include:

1. **Framer:** Ideal for creating interactive prototypes with a visual interface that can be translated into code.

2. **Webflow:** Allows you to design websites visually and export clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

3. **Sketch2React:** Converts Sketch designs into code components, making it easier to bring designs to life.

4. **Adalo:** A no-code platform for building web and mobile apps visually, with the ability to generate code for customization.

5. **Bubble:** Lets you create web applications without code, and it also provides an option to view and edit the generated code.

Remember, while these tools can be helpful, they might not cover all aspects of complex applications, and manual coding may still be required for fine-tuning and customization.

**user:**

can you suggest completely free versions

**assistant:**

Absolutely! Here are some free tools that allow you to create code from visual representations:

1. **Thunkable:** A no-code platform for building mobile apps visually. It's free with some limitations, but great for simple app development.

2. **MIT App Inventor:** Designed for building Android apps, it's a visual, drag-and-drop platform that generates code in the background. Completely free to use.

3. **Google Web Designer:** While primarily for creating HTML5 ads, it has a visual interface and can generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. It's free to download and use.

4. **Gravit Designer:** A vector design tool that allows you to create interfaces visually. While it doesn't generate code directly, it's handy for creating assets that can be used in web or app development. It's free with a Pro version available.

Always check the terms of use and limitations of each tool to ensure they meet your specific needs.
